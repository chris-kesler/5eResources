                  <h3>Spell Guide:  Dream</h3>
                    Dream is amazing.  
                    It's even more amazing if you use Spell Points rather than slots.  
                    Why is Dream amazing?  
                    All it can do is shape the dreams of other creatures right?  
                    What's so special about that?  
                    The answer to that is in the details of the spell description.  
                    <br><br>
                    Dream has two modes, one that lets you shape their dreams at your leisure, and another that lets you try to psychologically damage the character.  
                    If you can cast this using Spell Points throughout the entire day, you can simply sleep starve an enemy and kill them via exhaustion.  
                    But that's kinda cheesy, and requires that you and someone else take turns casting Dream so you can sleep yourself.  
                    The really special thing about dream is that there is no save to recognize the nonharmful dream as an illusion.  
                    This is inception+.  
                    <br><br>
                    Let me explain.  
                    <br><br>
                    If you go into someone's dream, let's say a military general, you can make a vision of that general carrying on the war effort.  
                    You can show how that course of action will end up leading to him insulting a Hag who enslaves his children's souls.  
                    <br><br>
                    Then restart the dream, and have him continuing the war effort pan out badly in a different way.  
                    Maybe this time, Wyverns pick his team apart and he never makes it home, only to watch his family starve without his support from beyond the veil of death.  
                    Or perhaps he contracts lycanthropy and ends up killing those closest to him due to the curse.  
                    <br><br>
                    The point is, you can play all the mindgames you want.  
                    <br><br>
                    And the victim will never know where the visions are actually coming from.
                    <br><br>
                    The dream vision is a classic DM tool used to help characters realize things about themselves or warn them of bad decisions.  
                    The victim will never know it wasn't a real vision if you don't try to psychologically damage them, so you can cast this everyday to truly haunt an enemy of yours.  
                    <br><br>
                    You can win wars without drawing a drop of blood, or convince the local lord that hiring your party to kill the trolls is the only way to save the city (even if the trolls aren't an actual threat).  
                    Bottom line, you can convince nearly anyone that some entity is trying to tell them something.  
                    You can appeal to their ambitions, threaten them with their greatest fears, or seduce them with their deepest desires.  
                    <br><br>
                    It makes you the ultimate puppet master, and is almost entirely untraceable.  
                    The methods needed to track you as the caster are not specific to this spell, meaning you woupd need to worry about them anyways even if you aren't casting Dream.
