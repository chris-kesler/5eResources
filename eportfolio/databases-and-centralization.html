            The artifact I have chosen to showcase my Database capabilities is KnowOne'sWebsiteOfEverything.com, which is a website containing styled directories and pages that populate data based on centralized JSON files with sortable and filterable table entries.  This artifact serves to showcase my competency with the JavaScript programming language, Microsoft Visual Studio Code, the HTML and CSS styling markup languages, web development principles, and observation of programming best practices such as naming conventions and comment etiquette.  While JavaScript is an arguably easy language to learn and use, the data centralization techniques used are far less elementary.  The ability to centralize data in a concise manner so as not to repeat yourself when making changes to content is a skill I deem notably worthy of showcase in a portfolio.  While this assignment is focused on the database aspect of this project, I am also including it in my portfolio as an example of my web development skills.  I intend to pursue a career in software engineering and web development, and this project showcases a combination of skills relevant to both that makes it the centerpiece of my portfolio.  The power of having a live website that can be linked to a prospective employer without needing to run anything from GitHub is likely of considerable value as well.

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            This project was developed by me in my spare time using self taught HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.  The project files include various webpages that read data from JSON files and populate the content within.  I developed this website in order to have a searchable presence online and to showcase my web development skills.  I quickly became irritated by manually changing the same information across multiple pages, so I began constructing scripts that would pull relevant data from JSON files.  I managed to condense everything to a point where dozens of webpages with different content when viewed from a browser are actually identical in terms of the HTML and Javascript code within the file.  
            <br><br>

            The script within pulls information from the JSON file based on the name of the file page, meaning I can copy the HTML file and rename it in order to create entirely different entries.  Attributes for the same item that are displayed on multiple pages do not need to be modified more than once; changing the JSON file will update the attribute in all places that it exists across the site.  At some point in the future, I might consider converting to SQL rather than JSON.  A demonstration of this project's functionality can be viewed below.

          <h4>Enhancement Progress</h4>
          <p>
            As with my other artifacts, the first element of this project that I tended to was the comment etiquette.  I failed to include proper comments throughout the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript elements.  I began by creating a generic page layout with appropriate comments describing each element, then applying that generic layout to all of my content pages.  The generic layout was then utilized and populated with a more comprehensive and adaptive JavaScript function, which I filled with descriptive comments as I refactored it.  There were quite a few loops that were implemented correctly and variables that were entirely unnecessary.  While the page loading speed wasn't impacted in a manner that can be noticed by the naked eye, the code is far easier to understand and modify now that improvements have been made.  All too often I found myself breaking the entire function and loading a blank page after making a seemingly small change to the script, only to find that it caused a series of issues elsewhere in the function.  I hope to continue improving these JavaScript function in the future, but they are in a state that I am proud to showcase as of now.  
          </p>

          <h4>Enhancement Reflection</h4>
          <p>
            While enhancing this artifact, I noticed that my filter table functionality is incredibly unstable and needs massive amounts of refactoring.  The script is bulky and difficult to modify, and the functionality is less than ideal even though it functions as expected flawlessly.  I also noticed that my CSS file is incredibly dense, potentially having a great deal of redundant content within it.  I am also still in the process of converting my old classes and ids from camelcase to lowercase with hyphens instead of spaces, whatever that naming convention may be called.  Otherwise, I didn't necessarily realize anything new upon revisiting this artifact since I have been working on it intimately nearly every day for the last four months.  I am constantly learning new ways to improve my website, and I do get the occasional revelation, but those are far less dramatic than the insight I gained from revisiting my other artifacts.

          <h4>Help and Resources</h4>
          <p>
            Most of the issues I ran into with this program involve Javascript and JSON technicalities, specifically the inability to receive error messages when a script doesn't want to work within an HTML page.  When first starting out, I had no idea how to use HTML or CSS since my university program never covered them in any detail.  This turned out to be just fine since they are relatively easy to learn compared to the other programming languages and principles.  I used the following tutorials to get a grasp of the fundamentals, both in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSON.

          <h4>Version History</h4>
          <p>
            In truth, this project is still in constant development.  While I have subscribed to a hosting service so this website can remain live all the time, I still have a great deal of work to do before I consider it completed.  I have been making small tweaks and adjustments for months now, and intend to continue doing so before I am completely satisfied.  That being said, I have retroactively located several key points in the lifespan of this project for the sake of version history.  They are described as follows.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              v1.0.0
              <ul>
                <li>
                  Initial Release 
                </li>
                <li>
                  While I would like to publish this release, I was using images downloaded from the internet without proper credit or usage rights at the time.  This was always acceptable for personal use in the past, but is sorely inappropriate for this project.  Since this project could be considered commercial if I gain employment based on the content within, I converted my image use practices to those that are entirely compliant with full commercial use to the best of my knowledge.  This involves images that have been purchased with permission for commercial use, images under the Creative Commons License that are rehosted with author and source credit, and images I have no rights to that are only linked without any rehosting.  Given this, I do not think it appropriate to package and release the initial stages of this project prior to legal image use conversion.

                <li>
                  While there is a great deal to continue improving, this release involves a polished version of the existing functionality and an ePortfolio showcasing my accomplishments in Computer Science.

I often input a summary of a given entry, allowed the program to add to it, and continued submitting the program's own changes back to it.  As a result, it can write a fair portion of a given page's content, such as the Turquoise Dragon's page description for example.
