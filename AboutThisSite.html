                Welcome to Know One's Website of Everything!
              </center></h2>
              <p>
                I created this site in order to showcase my skills with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.  
                As a Computer Science major, the industry that I am navigating is very competitive, prioritizing proof of talent in portfolio projects over certifications and degrees.  
                This site is my portfolio proof of talent project for the markup languages mentioned above.  
                <br><br>
                Every portfolio project requires a large amount of consistent effort in order for it to see completion.  
                I wanted to make something that I actually found useful and interesting, otherwise I worried I might lose interest and never complete the project.  
                That is why I decided to make the content of this site almost entirely related to Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition.  
                D&D has always been something that excites and motivates me, so it seemed a natural choice.  
                <br><br>
                My perspective on D&D is not one shared by everyone.  
                Many players and Dungeon Masters find character optimization "distasteful" in some way or another.  
                I believe that this is a flawed mentality.  
                I truly believe within the negative experiences that shaped these opinions on character optimization, character optimization was never the root of the problem.  
                The root of the problem was a lack of respect for the table.  
                <br><br>
                I don't want to write an entire essay on how optimizing isn't inherently bad, or how optimization and immersive roleplaying are not mutually exclusive.  
                Other people have gone over that in great detail, and if you really need convincing, then this site might not be for you.  
                With that out of the way, let's get into the my core principles of TTRPG etiquette.
