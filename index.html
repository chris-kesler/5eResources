                The content within is mostly related to Dungeons and Dragons 5th Edition, which is a table top roleplaying game that I thoroughly enjoy.  

                I chose this topic since I found it easy to remain motivated to continue working on this project.

                <b>
                  Feel free to check out "Deities", "Magic", "Monsters", and "Planes" within the Nraanon Wiki above!  
                  There are also entries within Game Journals and Character Builds that are being updated regularly.
                </b>
                <br>The other two sections of the site are not ready for viewing.  

                <br><br>
                This website is broken down into five main categories, which are 5e Resources, Character Builds, Nraanon Wiki, and Tech Guides.
                <br><br>
                5e Resources is yet to be developed, but the plan is to create a list with comprehensive filters for 5th Edition content.  
                Rather than pirating the content itself, only the title and attributes for filtering purposes will be present, with the game content being replaced with a link to the relevant page on D&D Beyond's website.  
                The last thing I want to do is undermine D&DB or undercut their profits as I am a massive Wizards of the Coast fan.
                <br><br>
                My Character Builds go hand in hand with some Tech Guide articles.  
                These pages detail 5th Edition characters that I have built as concepts, and some have been tested in actual play.  
                The overview discusses the goal of the build, the tables go over the choices made at each level, and the tier breakdowns explain how the character is meant to be played at each stage of its life cycle.  
                As another disclaimer, some of these builds are considered "broken" and might reduce the enjoyment of other players at the table.  
                Some of these are intended for actual play, and some are thought experiments to test the game mechanics and limits.  
                The tone of the table must be considered before playing any character, including these builds.
                <br><br>
                Game Journals are logs of my experiences with various games usch as Minecraft, No Man's Sky, and D&D.  
                The goal of this section is to document my progress for personal viewing and review purposes.  
                As such, these are not very entertaining for most people, but if you are curious to see what I've been up to, feel free to take a look.
                <br><br>
                The Nraanon Wiki is a series of entries with descriptions that detail my homebrew world, which is heavily inspired by the standard Forgotten Realms setting.  
                Many aspects will be recognizable to avid fans of D&D, but there are a great many tweaks and utterly unique elements that distinguish it as its own.  
                The purpose of this wiki is to serve as an organized reference for lore and information, both for myself as a Dungeon Master and for the Players at my table.
                <br><br>
                The Tech Guides are a series of articles I have written that go over Techs (techniques) that are highly effective within the gameplay of D&D 5e.  
                Some of these techs are rather exploitative of unintended mechanical interactions, but none are written with the intent of causing strife for other table members.  
                Some are merely thought experiments to see where the limits of the game lie, and how badly it breaks the game to push past those limits.  
                Others are strategies that help players make the most of their character's abilities.  
                These techs should not be considered for actual play without first considering the table environment, and are more intended to comment on the nature of 5th Edition mechanics.
                <br><br>
                Beyond those five categories, I have also advertised myself to a small degree.  
                I have linked my GitHub account, LinkedIn profile, and Discord Server so that anyone who wants to reach out for any reason can do so.
                <br><br>
                As I mentioned before, I have taken the art in this project from various places across the internet.  
                I have put in an effort to select art that is tactful, as there are many rather tasteless depiction of fantasy characters in existence.  
                While some may disagree, I find the idea that every feminine being need be depicted in an arousing way to be extremely tasteless and unprofessional.  
                Some of those depictions are certainly nice to look at, but many of them seem ridiculously unrealistic.  
                That may sound ironic when discussing a fictional world with magic, monsters, and gods, but those are all based on immersive assumptions.  
                I loathe boob-plate and sword swinging warriors in high heels because there are no implicit assumptions about physics or combat working differently than they do in the real world.  
                Eg, physical armor still needs to cover most of your body to protect you.
                <br><br>
                That being said, I have done my best to exclude art I find to be in poor taste, favoring depictions that are respectful and high quality.  
                I am not an objective filter by any means, and while I may have improved upon whatever the first google results might be, there very well may be an unfair and recognizable distinction between how feminine and masculine entities are presented.  
                I would greatly appreciate any specific feedback on this topic, especially if one or more replacement images are suggested.  
                This isn't something that I will ever preach about to the masses since I don't think it is wrong for artists to depict their subjects in whatever way they please, but it is kind of annoying and time-consuming to sift through.  
                I believe that burden can be made much lighter through collaboration though.
                <br><br>
                I have looked into the legality behind using art found online and it turns out that heavy fines and other penalties can be accrued, even for a portfolio project that never accrues any income.  
                While it may be unlikely to occur, I like to make sure that my ass is covered.  
                For this reason, I have avoided all art that is not classified for public use unless I have received the express consent of the artist.  
                <br><br>
                In the meantime, I have been using and will continue to use images under the Creative Commons License for the majority of this project.  
                Let me be clear, most Creative Commons images have a very tacky and cheap feel to them, so please try not to judge this site based on the images therein.  
                I'm doing my best to make something impressive without breaking laws.
                <br><br>
                If you have any feedback or comments for me regarding anything related to this or other projects, feel free to contact me in any of the ways mentioned above.
