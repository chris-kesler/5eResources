      <p>
        The world of Nraanon takes heavy inspiration from a specific time
        period in the Forgotten Realms with my own unique customizations.
        Nraanon most closely resembles a fantasy world, with Dwarves, Humans,
        Orcs, Elves, and other standard fantasy races making up the majority
        of the population.  There are also Tieflings, Genasi, Minotaurs,
        and several other more exotic races.  These races will be largely
        recognizable by most fans of fantasy, but most will also be unique to
        this setting in terms of quirks, physiology, and culture.  The most
        notable shift will be the role that magic has to play in Nraanon.

      <p>
        A thousand years ago, a mysterious rupture in the planar fabric
        caused all magic to cease function for nearly ten minutes.  This
        caused the utopian flying cities to crash down to the earth,
        leaving the millions dead and civilization in ruins.  There were
        survivors of course, but they soon learned that life had changed
        forever.  A new manner of creature began to roam the land, greedily
        feeding on magical energy wherever it could be found.  The mages that
        did survive the Fall.
