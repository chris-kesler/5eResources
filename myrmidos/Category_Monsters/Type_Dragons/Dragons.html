              There are four subtypes of Dragons; Draconid, Chromatic, Metallic, and Gemstone.
              <br><br>
              The first dragon was a Titan of the Material Plane, and sought to feed on the energy of the other planes and their Titans.  
              This fifth Titan was unlike the others in that it reproduced asexually, and in astounding numbers.  
              However, each of this Titan's offspring were widely varied in size, with some nearing a third of their parent's colossal proportions, and others never exceeding that of a riding horse.  
              All the dragon offspring served the dragon Titan much like bees serve their queen.  
              They had no choice; they were forced to assist in the attack on the other planes led by the dragon Titan.
              <br><br>
              The four Primal Titans fought side by side to destroy this dragon, slaying as many of her children as possible along the way.  
              All the dragons of notable size were destroyed, but many many smaller and even medium sized dragons were able to scurry away.
              <br><br>
              These swarms of surviving dragon offspring scattered to the corners of every plane seeking refuge.  
              Few remained on the Material Plane, as the stench of their dead mother still affected them in a negative way.  
              Those that did stay became the Draconids as they devolved into Wyverns and Drakes; reduced to four limbs, devoid of breath weapons, and behaving as little more than beasts.  
              <br><br>
              However, the dragons that sought refuge in the elemental planes had a very different fate in store for them.  
              They were able to adapt and survive, absorbing the energy of the plane they reside on over many thousands of years.  
              This is how the Chromatic dragons came to be.
              <br><br>
              The Red dragons hail from the plane of Fire.<br>
              The Shadow dragons hail from the plane of Ash.<br>
              The Blue dragons hail from the plane of Air.<br>
              The White dragons hail from the plane of Ice.<br>
              The Dracoturtles hail from the plane of Water.<br>
              The Green dragons hail from the plane of Ooze.<br>
              The Black dragons hail from the plane of Earth.              
              <br><br>
              You may have noticed that the plane of Magma is excluded above.  
              The dragons who fled to the plane of magma were welcomed by Gondarin.  
              Not all trusted him, but those that did were taken and forged into Brass dragons by Gondarin's hand.  
              He gilded both their bodies and their souls, converting them to a Good alignment.  
              In return for this gift, Gondarin asked that they drive out the other dragons from his domain.  
              They did so, and as a result, no dragon native to the plane of Magma ever evolved organically.
              <br><br>
              After many eons, the planar aspects that these dragons had absorbed became part of their heritage.  
              The stench of the dead dragon Titan had long faded, but the Creator Race had always kept extraplanar threats at bay.  
              After the Genies slaughtered the Creator Race and were confined to vessels during The Binding, the dragons saw an opportunity to return to the Material Plane.  
              <br><br>
              The surviving members of the Creator Race were forged into the other Metallic Dragons, and charged with watching over mankind.  
              They retained their innate ability to shapechange, allowing them to walk amog mankind.  
              Gondarin's Brass Dragons shared their benevolence, and were granted the ability to shapechange as well.  
              <br><br>
              Frydeia saw that the Chromatic dragons were Evil, and that Gondarin's Metallic dragons were Good.  
              This pleased her in that it brought balance to the draconic race.  
              Inspired by this, she reached out to Gondarin in hopes of a collaboration project.  
              Frydeia and Gondarin further solidified this newfound balance by creating a synthetic race of dragons whose bodies are made of gemstones and souls are raw psionic power.  
              These Gemstone dragons were to remain neutral, only intervening when the chromatics or metallics gained a massive advantage over the other.  
              These dragons embody Frydeia's and Gondarin's ability to cooperate despite their differences, and symbolize their enduring, albeit distant, relationship.
              <br><br>
              And so, the dragons as we know them came to be.
