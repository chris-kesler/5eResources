It is strongly associated with domains relating to Adaptability and Cleansing, and is considered to represent the Neutral alignment in its purest form.  This plane is the source of all Abjuration magic, channeling raw energy from the Weave and converting it to magic of the aforementioned school.  The Plane of Water is adjacent to the Primal Planes of Earth to the Southwest, and Air to the Northwest.  The Border Planes at these junctions are the Plane of Ooze and the Plane of Ice, which are also known as the Feywilds and Eifrost respectively.  ",
