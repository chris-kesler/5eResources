              The four Elemental Titans Deities were the first sentient beings to form in the universe.  
              Much in the same way that dense matter attracts other matter in space, dense energy attracts more energy.  
              A type of energy specific to each plane begin to accumulate over eons, becoming capable of interacting with the environment.  
              Eventually, these masses of planar energy became alive and sentient.  
              For a very long time, these Titans were simply masses of their respective element.  
              It is not known when or how the Titans developed their preferences for their appearances, but they developed the ability to take on a more corporeal form.  
              The Titan of Air presents as an avian, the Titan of Water presents as a cephalopod, the Titan of Earth a reptiles, and the Titan of Fire an insect.  
              They have aspects that are more complex than that, but even the brief description above shows that they are far more than standard elementals.  
              In fact, it has been theorized that the origins of the standard elementals involve pieces of the Titans themselves that remained alive after detachment.  
              It's also quite possible that they came to be from pure planar energy just as the Titans did, and it is unknown if a method to test this exists.
