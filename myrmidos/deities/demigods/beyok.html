                  Beyok is a Golden Greatwyrm, and is widely considered the eldest living Greatwyrm in existence.  In his youth, Beyok took the form of a mortal and befriended a human king named Urigeth.  Urigeth sought to conduct a crusade against the chaos and barbarism of his time, and Beyok joined him.  Together, they brought fire and steel upon many of the bandits that plagued the lands.  Nearing the end of the crusade, Beyok had to reveal his true form in order to save his friend from certain death.  Urigeth was filled with wrath at this deception, but eventually accepted the reality of Beyok's nature.  Urigeth's council was far less understanding.  
                  <br><br>
                  After succeeding in their conquest, Urigeth held a banquet.  His mead had been poisoned, and Beyok sensed it too late.  Urigeth died quickly, and the members of his council attempted to frame Beyok for the murder.  Beyok was having none of it, and it took all he had not to burn the entire castle to the ground.  Frustrated with the politics of mortalkind, Beyok decided to leave the human kingdom, never to return.  
                  <br><br>
                  In the many years since, Beyok has been known to live among the commoners and help them drive off monsters that they could never hope to without assitance.  Beyok still exhibits a drastic distaste for the politics of mortalkind, but holds a great deal of reverance for leaders who show virtue.  Beyok is often represented with the emblem of a torn banner that bears Urigeth's sigil of House Ketran (a pale green salmon), which he is often seen wearing as a makeshift poncho and cloak when in mortal form.
