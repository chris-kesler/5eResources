              The four Greater Deities are the children of the Elemental Titans.  The Titans of Air and Water sired Frydeia, the Titans of Water and Earth sired Deliklese, the Titans of Earth and Fire sired Gondarin, and the Titans of Fire and Air sired Sebabos.  The Titans that are of opposing elements did not have any children together.  
              <br><br>
              These four Greater Deities took on aspects of their parents, but also became unique in many ways.  Their humanoid appearance is the most obvious example.  While the Titans would remain as beastly lords over their planes, the Greater Deities chose to actively shape their border plane homes.  
              <br><br>
              Frydeia embodies Law, stirring the residents of her plane to form creeds and hold themselves to a code.  Delikelese embodies Good, enjoying the most pleasurable things existence offers and seeding life with every touch.  Gondarin embodies Chaos, building a workshop within a volcano to forge unique weapons and creatures to satisfy his need for artistic expression.  Sebabos embodies Evil, seeking to drain the energy from anything he laid hands upon.
