                <p>
                  I once read a guide on how to play a "god" Wizard in D&D that was written by Treantmonk, and I instantly fell in love with the concept.
                  I had played Paladins and Rogues prior, but every attempt to play a spellcaster left me feeling like a glass cannon that should pack way more punch.
                  After reading the god wizard guide, I took a totally different approach.
                  I started playing Wizards who focused on battlefield control and I loved every second of it.
                  However, the Wizard does have some weaknesses such as Armor Class and weak Saving Throws, but my goal with this build is to maximize my godly power while wrapping up loose defensive ends.

                  The overall goal of this build is to serve as a force multiplier.  
                  I want to make my allies more powerful and my enemies less so.  
                  With that in mind, I have laid out the spells and strategies that I think would best serve each tier of gameplay.

                  Low levels are rough and unforgiving.  
                  The main objective here is to keep at least one enemy combatant out of the fight until the rest of the party is ready to gang up on them.  
                  We'll be taking the Guidance and Thorn Whip cantrips from Artificer, as well as Chill Touch, Mind Sliver, and Ray of Frost from Wizard.  
                  Four of these five cantrips do damage, but the reason I chose them is for the debuffs they inflict.  
                  Thorn Whip can be used to force enemies to be subjected to my AoEs more often than they might be otherwise.  
                  Chill Touch blocks hit point regen, which makes it my favorite combat cantrip in 5e.  
                  Mind Sliver grants a debuff to the next saving throw, which is rare, and on a cantrip this is awesome for setting up a ton of things.  
                  Ray of Frost reduces the target's speed, which seems negligible until you factor in ranged combat and the prone condition.  
                  Guidance is not a combat cantrip, but it goes very very nicely with Gift of Alacrity.  
                  Our Initiative sits at 1d20 + Dex + 1d8 + 1d4 most of the time.
                  At level three we get Tactical Wit, so now our already great Initiative gets our Int mod on top.  
                  We should always be going first, but what do we do with our leading turn in combat?  
                </p>
                <p>
                  To start, we have Faerie Fire right from level one.  
                  If the opportunity presents itself, then laying down Faerie Fire on a large group of enemies should be our first turn.  
                  If not, then we can use Thorn Whip to pull enemies into flanking positions or out of positions that flank allies.  
                  There really isn't much you can do at level 1 other than this.  
                  At level 2, we get a lot more spells.  
                  This is why we love Wizards; knowing tons of spells.  
                  We have a couple good AoEs and a great single target debuff.  
                  Fog Cloud is great for blinding ranged enemies until we can close the distance for our melee members to do their dirty work.  
                  Grease is excellent for choke points, and pairs nicely with Thorn Whip.  
                  Mind Sliver should always preceed Command.  
                  If the party is facing a group with a boss in it, Mind Sliver followed by Command Grovel on the boss can make a world of difference.  
                  It might be best to spend a round or two Greasing up the little guys so everyone can kill them and properly team up on the prone boss.  
                  It would be pretty sad if our Mind Sliver + Command worked but nobody actually went and hit the boss while they're down. . . 
                </p>
                <p>
                  At level 3, we add two more spells and a Wizard subclass.  
                  Shield boosts our already great defenses, and Absorb Elements is an especially good insurance against dragons and mages.  
                  What is interesting is that we now have a 2nd level spell slot, but we are unable to prepare any 2nd level spells.  
                  This is going to be a recurring theme due to the multiclass.  
                  Right now, there are only two things we can use that slot for: Cure Wounds and Command.  
                  Now we can Command two targets with one casting, so the boss and his closest lackey can suffer a wasted prone turn.  
                  Mind Sliver setup still applies to only one, so keep putting that on the boss.
                  We also get Arcane Deflection, which is my second favorite Wizard feature in 5e.  
                  I love to make my saving throws.  
                  At this point we are still doing mostly the same thing as we were before, but now we are less likely to die and can Command two enemies at once.  
                  Level 4 brings many new options as we get our first second level spell preps.
