            A website containing styled directories and pages that populate data based on centralized JSON files with sortable and filterable table entries.  
          </p>

          <h3>Description</h3>
          <p>
            This project was developed by me in my spare time using self taught HTML, CSS, and Javascript skills.  The project files include various webpages that read data from JSON files and populate the content within.  I developed this website in order to have a searchable presence online and to showcase my web development skills.  I quickly became irritated by manually changing the same information across multiple pages, so I began constructing scripts that would pull relevant data from JSON files.  I managed to condense everything to a point where dozens of webpages with different content when viewed from a browser are actually identical in terms of the HTML and Javascript code within the file.  
            
            <br><br>The script within pulls information from the JSON file based on the name of the file page, meaning I can copy the HTML file and rename it in order to create entirely different entries.  Attributes for the same item that are displayed on multiple pages do not need to be modified more than once; changing the JSON file will update the attribute in all places that it exists across the site.  At some point in the future, I might consider converting to SQL rather than JSON.  
          </p>

          <h3>Getting Started</h3>

          </ul>
          <p><i>*potentially not required, but it is what I used and therefore know for certain that it works</i></p>

          <h4>Installing</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Install the Live Server Extension to Visual Studio Code via the Extensions tab within VSC || <a href='https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_wue59ldqMg&ab_channel=TechStacker'>How to Set Up a Local Live Server in Visual Studio Code (quickly)</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Download the Project Files from the Project Repository on GitHub || <a href='https://github.com/christian-kesler/knowones-website-of-everything'>Link to Repository</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              Cloning the Repository via Git is ideal, but downloading a zip and extracting it will also work || <a href='https://git-scm.com/downloads'>Link to Download Git</a>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h4>Executing Program</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You can create a new project in Visual Studio Code using existing project files, create an empty project and move the project files into the new directory, manually, or create an empty project and clone directly to that folder using Git</li>
            <li>Navigate to the main project directory while in Visual Studio Code</li>
            <li>Right click on the index.html page and select "Open with Liver Server"</li>
            <li>Begin navigating the site as though it were a typical website
              <ul>
                <li>For example, you can navigate to "Project Portfolio" in the top right of the Header, then select the "Dynamic Filter Table: JSON Database (Javascript)" page to be taken to a locally hosted version of the exact page you are reading right now</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Help</h3>
          <p>
            Most of the issues I ran into with this program involve Javascript and JSON technicalities, specifically the inability to receive error messages when a script doesn't want to work within an HTML page.  When first starting out, I had no idea how to use HTML or CSS since my university program never covered them in any detail.  This turned out to be just fine since they are relatively easy to learn compared to the other programming languages and principles.  I used the following tutorials to get a grasp of the fundamentals, both in HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSON.

          <h3>Version History</h3>
          <p>
            In truth, this project is still in constant development.  While I have subscribed to a hosting service so this website can remain live all the time, I still have a great deal of work to do before I consider it completed.  I have been making small tweaks and adjustments for months now, and intend to continue doing so before I am completely satisfied.  That being said, I have retroactively located several key points in the lifespan of this project for the sake of version history.  They are described as follows.
