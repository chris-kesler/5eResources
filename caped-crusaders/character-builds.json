He employs a series of Powers that heighten his natural strength, balance, and reflexes, along with some trained Techniques that enhance his stealthiness and accuracy.  He relies on webbing to immobilize enemies, runaway vehicles, falling debris, and many other environmental  hazards.  His webbing also allows him far greater mobility while remaining stealthy.  <br><br>There are lots of ways you could build a Spider-Man character in Caped Crusaders, but this build will try to focus on the conventional role Spider-Man usually takes when on a team.  Peter is a real powerhouse, but constantly holds back in physical combat with few exceptions.  When working with other heroes, Spidey often relies on his webbing and agility to tailor the battlefield for his allies rather than fight a boss villain one on one like we see in his solo adventures.  Spider-Man Noir tends to stick to the shadows on his solo andventures, but that isn't always an option on a team.  Spider-Man Noir does not lean into the genius side of Peter as much, and so we'll stick to the Wisdom skills rather than the Intelligence skills.  Insight, Perception, and so on, will help give us that gritty dark private eye kinda feel when not in combat.  <br><br>This Spider-Man is not at the center of the stage, and that's exactly how we want it for this build.

            "build_overview" : "The Amazing Spider-Man is the original Peter Parker from the first run of Spider-Man comics, and what I consider to be the default Spider-Man that is seen most often on Marvel teams.  This is a Spider-Man who relies on webbing to do the heavy lifting and tailor the battlefield for his allies, while also making sure to keep a safe distance from nasty threats.  <br><br>There are lots of ways you could build a Spider-Man character in Caped Crusaders, but this build will try to focus on the conventional role Spider-Man usually takes when on a team.  Peter is a real powerhouse, but constantly holds back in physical combat with few exceptions.  When working with other heroes, Spidey often relies on his webbing and agility to alter the terms of engagement rather than fight a boss villain one on one like we see in his solo adventures.  <br><br>This Spider-Man build does not lean into the genius side of Peter as much since it is relevant to game mechanics in almost no way.  Peter may be a genius, but it's not exactly something that comes up often in combat.  Most of his abilities are based on his powers and senses.  I know I know, he comes up with clever gizmos to defeat specific enemies, but he doesn't rely on raw Intelligence (or even develop it much; his academic performance is often in shambles for the majority of his life) for most of his abilities.  We can be a more effective Spider-Man if we leave the genius side of Peter represented with appropriate skill and tool proficiencies, which do the job just fine in my estimation regardless.  <br><br>In conclusion, we will be sticking to Wisdom for this build and opting for Int based skills.  We will be taking lots of control casting options to represent the various applications for webbing, and we will do our best to stay out of the fray.  This Spider-Man is not at the center of the stage, and that's exactly how we want it.  <br><br>*Technical note, some of you may protest the use of Powercasting to represent Spidey's web based abilities since his webshooters are actually technological devices.  In theory, we could try to build a Spider-Man that uses Techcasting to represent webbing, but Powercasting also represents Spider-Man's extreme feats of agility and strength.  A build that does use Techcasting based webbing would be the Iron Spider, who also employs a variety of other gadgets.  Webshooters alone aren't necessarily complex enough to be represented through Techcasting in my estimation.  Peter's ability to use his webbing effectively relies more heavily on his natural reflexes and accuracy than on the technology of the webbing or webshooters themselves.  If this perspective continues to bother you, then this build can also be used top represent Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man (whose webbing is organic and has no technological components whatsoever).  ",
