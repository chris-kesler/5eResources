          <h3>Informal Code Review</h3>
          <p>
            This is the informal code review I conducted immediately after selecting my Artifacts for inclusion in this ePortfolio.  I go over each Artifact in relevant detail and ask a series of questions on how I might enhance it.  The Artifacts have since undergone the enhancements, but the original versions can still be found among the GitHub repository's releases.

          <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>

          <h4>Impact of my B. Sc. of Computer Science program</h4>
          <p>
            Throughout my B. Sc. of Computer Science program, I have been exposed to a great many new concepts and technologies.  Each of the courses I have taken at Southern New Hampshire University has presented useful information that I strived to absorb, which has culminated in the grasp of computer science I have now.  My competency in this field is on display in the Artifacts listed above, but the question becomes what to do with myself now that I'm equipped with this knowledge.  
            
            <br><br>
            My professional goals upon beginning this program were vague as I had yet to even understand the types of positions the industry had to offer, let alone decide where I might find my niche.  I hoped to learn what career fields are realistic and best for me throughout my program, which thankfully turned out to be the case.  Upon taking several Game Programming and Development electives, I seriously considered a career in Simulation Technology as it relates to medicine, aviation, and defense.  While I still find this technology highly compelling, I was lost on how to pursue such a thing in a personal project.  Instead, I turned to creating an online presence for myself since it seemed a critical step for any programmer to take.  That endeavor was highly rewarding and had instant, tangible results; I created a website that I could show to other people and browse from other devices whenever I wanted.  I continued working on it nearly every day after beginning the project months ago, and still do so as I near graduation from my Bachelor's program.  The result of that effort was twofold:  the website you are viewing now, and the decision to pursue Web Development in tandem with Software Engineering.  
            
            <br><br>
            Most of my courses at SNHU covered a wide variety of general knowledge Computer Science principles and languages.  These included Java, JUnit testing, C++, C#, Unreal Engine, OpenGL, Python, Data Structures and Algorithms, Distributed Version Control, and Team Development and Collaboration.  All of these were invaluable in shaping my fundamental understanding of computer technology, but none of my courses covered CSS or Javascript in any capacity.  Only one course implemented any HTML, and it was minimal since the focus of that course was interacting with databases using Python scripts.  I point this out not to fault my program (in truth, I think my program has done an excellent job of equipping me with relevant technical knowledge), but to point out that all the language specific skills on display within this website are entirely self-taught.  Not only has my degree program given me a well-rounded competency that effectively prepares me for a career using the languages and principles covered in SNHU's course material, but it also equipped me with the self driven discipline and research strategies needed to independently learn new skills from free and open sources.  

            <br><br>
            Given how much I have truly enjoyed learning at SNHU (and I mean that sincerely), I fully intend to continue learning and improving my understanding beyond graduation.  I intend to pursue a career with my current skills and level of education, but also plan to independently study new things or possibly pursue a Graduate Program part-time while maintaining my career starting in 2023 (assuming I can manage such a schedule).  I have come a long way already, and I don't seek to demean my accomplishments or parade my ambition by this, but there is still a great deal that I do not know.  One of the primarily appealing things about a career is having a clear direction or goal to focus one's efforts towards.  For someone such as myself who experiences higher levels of neuroticism when conscientiousness isn't being prioritized, that appeal becomes almost irresistible.  
          </p>

          <h4>Written Communication Overall</h4>
          <p>
            I make an effort to take my written work seriously, and I can only hope that my ability to articulate myself has been demonstrated thus far.  Regarding my ability to communicate effectively, I have several additional examples to showcase should that might be of interest.  They are listed in order of completion, with my oldest work being at the top and my newest work at the bottom.  
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a target='blank' href='/resources/documents/Data Structures and Algorithms-converted.pdf'>Data Structures and Algorithms</a>
            </li>
            <li>
              <a target='blank' href='/resources/documents/Data Analysis, SQL-converted.pdf'>Data Analysis, SQL</a> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <a target='blank' href='/resources/documents/MilleniAds Consultation Report-converted.pdf'>MilleniAds Consultation Report</a> 
            </li>
            <li>
              <a target='blank' href='/resources/documents/Fundamentals of Data Mining, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co-converted.pdf'>Fundamentals of Data Mining, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co</a> 
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul> 
          <p>
            These examples serve to show my ability to effectively articulate scientific issues related to computer technology and other complex subjects in both advanced academic terms and in concise summaries.  I admit that the first three items in this list could certainly be improved.  However, I have included them not only as standalone examples of my communication skills, but also to show the amount of improvement I have made during my time at SNHU.  I also made a point to adhere to APA7 formatting in my later courses, which can be seen in the lowest two entries.  
          </p>

          <h4>Communicating to Shareholders</h4>
          <p>
            Regarding communication to shareholders specifically, I highly recommend examining the "Fundamentals of Data Mining, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co" document.  The entire purpose of the assignment involved studying database statistics and presenting observations and conclusions to shareholders as actionable insights.  While those involved in academia are often all too happy to look into information and note trends simply for the sake of it, shareholders and others who are mainly concerned with making effective business decisions will find such an approach bordering on useless.  It's important to understand that in business, any statistical observation made must have clear causes and effects that directly relate to the success of the organization.  In the "Fundamentals of Data Mining, Bubba Gump Shrimp Co" document, I make a point to discuss the data in depth while being transparent about which observations are useful.  I also make a point to offer suggestions as to what the observations might mean for the business and potential actions to take a result.
          </p>

          <h4>Collaboration in Team Environments</h4>
          <p>
            One of my most notable courses primarily focused on version control best practices, but also involved collaborating in a team environment.  In this course we were each tasked with contributing to a relatively simple Java application.  Every student had to add a custom object to an array, which ended up resulting in quite a few testing errors.  This was due to the tests being set on fixed items within the array, but adding new entries in various places offset the order of the actual array.  Another student and I were able to come up with a looping test case that would sweep the array for our custom object regardless of our position within the array, preventing additions from other students from causing errors with our contributions.  We then shared our snippet of code to everyone else in the class via Slack, leading several others to enhance their test cases and the program overall.  This example showcases an understanding of working in a team environment, collaborative communication, and effective problem solving within that environment.  
            
            <br><br>
            Another project that showcases team collaboration involves a Game Programming and Development elective I took which created teams of four students.  My team and I were tasked with creating a playable game, and divided the work into a series of roles.  I took the role of the programmer, which involved creating all the mechanical functionality for the player pawn and actors within the environment.  The team artist would often create assets such as a laser beam and link them to choppy demo controls simply to show me what they ought to do and how it was designed.  I would then take those demo controls and modify them extensively, including enemy damage, ammo count, cooldowns, and aiming mechanics.  When creating attributes such as health and controls such as reloading for the character, I would often link everything to an extremely crude demo HUD.  This would then be passed on to the team UI/UX developer, who would be able to cosmetically improve my work and rearrange things as needed.  Both of these examples serve to show an understanding of team environment dynamics, how to improve individual effectiveness through specialization, and how to improve team effectiveness by understanding and communicating with other positions.  

            <br><br>
            While this might seem an opportune time to discuss my leadership skills and potential, I am not going to do that.  I may or may not have the skills needed to take on a leadership role, but I find that focusing on leadership in and of itself can be potentially oxymoronic.  Elon Musk once said in an interview with Lex Fridman, "A lot of the time, the people you want as leaders are the people who don't want to be leaders" <a target='blank' href='https://youtu.be/DxREm3s1scA?t=8360'><i>(link here)</i></a>, and I find this to be true in my experiences.  Leadership inherently carries an extremely heavy burden, and those who understand how difficult the responsibilities are tend to avoid seeking them out.  With that in mind, it's a wonder anyone actively seeks out leadership positions at all.  It's possible that leadership is associated with a heightened level of competency, or (more cynically) is rewarding from an egotistical perspective.  I also think that there are very few skills exclusive to leadership, and that many of the practices commonly associated with leadership training are just as beneficial if not more so for those who are not in leadership positions.  Given all of this, I am choosing to instead focus on developing and showcasing my ability to collaborate effectively and be a positive element within a team environment.  I might not even be able to provide an accurate analysis of my leadership potential given my personal biases, and will therefore leave my potential and competency as a leader up to my colleagues to determine.  
          </p>

          <h4>Data Structures and Algorithms</h4>
          <p>
            The "Data Structures and Algorithms" document linked above goes over an explanation of various data structure theories and the relevant algorithms that can be used to manipulate them.  Again, this paper was written relatively early on in my program and may not adhere to APA7 writing practices or represent my current ability to communicate in writing.  While I did select a Hash Table for the Student's Choice section, I have since delved into the mathematics behind the various operations that can be performed on these data structures.  After determining that a Binary Search Tree is identical in theory to a series of nested Hash Tables with only two entries each, I became partially obsessed with Binary Search Trees; even to the point that I have included an Artifact showcasing one in this portfolio.  I find the ability to mathematically predict the maximum number of comparisons needed for any given entry based on the number of entries in the BST extremely powerful (the equation is essentially "2^x = n" where n is the number of entries and x is the number of comparisons), but I still fail to grasp how the average number of comparisons performed for a randomly selected entry is calculated (which is found by calculating "O(log(n))").  I intend to keep digging and exploring data structures, so hopefully an enlightening realization will come upon me down the road.  This Artifact and explanation serve to showcase a passionate and self driven approach, along with a focused approximation of my level of understanding in this are.  
          </p>

          <h4>Software Engineering and Databases</h4>
          <p>
            I would like to once again reference my website as a testament to my software engineering skills, and understanding of data centralization principles.  While most of this site has to do with HTML elements and CSS styling, several pages such as <a href="http://knowoneswebsiteofeverything.com/caped-crusaders/sustainable-techniques.html">"Techniques"</a> and other filter tables under Character Options within Caped Crusaders rely on a great deal of script to operate.  For example, by clicking on the "Level" button on the Techniques page, you will see that the entries in the table sort themselves based on the integer value displayed, not the string value.  If it were relying on the string value, then the Iron Resolve entry with a Level of 10th would be listed as less than Reverse Engineering with a Level value of 1st.  This same function also effectively sorts the entries by the strings in the other columns when another button such as "Name" is clicked.  This demonstrates an adaptive script that handles multiple input types and formats without errors while creating a pleasant and intuitive user experience.  I've also centralized all the entry data in a JSON file, which is read from by both the table pages and the entry pages navigated to upon clicking an entry's name.  If you want to read more about this, check out the "Databases & Centralization: JSON Database (Javascript)" Artifact above.  
          </p>

          <h4>Security</h4>
          <p>
            As much I would like to end on a strong note, the topic of security is one I would not claim I possess exceptional insight into.  While I did take a Cybersecurity course at SNHU, it primarily covered the mathematical operations behind encryption and decryption.  That is not to say that I am incompetent regarding cybersecurity, quite the contrary in fact (which I found highly compelling).  I can say that I take security seriously, both in the physical and digital senses.  The "MilleniAds Consultation Report" document above goes over a strategic plan to implement security protocols and programs across systems, networks, file structures, and the company site.  This serves to show an awareness of organizational security vulnerabilities along with solutions to protect those vulnerabilities.  My main shortcoming when showcasing security skills involves my difficulty in finding a project that can display competency in this area specifically.  As such, I am instead referencing my report that details security plans and pointing out actions I've taken that showcase an awareness of security vulnerabilities, such as keeping my discord bot token private within the <a target='blank' href='https://github.com/christian-kesler/Citadel_Financial'>"Citadel Financial GitHub repository"</a>.  An awareness of security can also be seen in the "Databases & Centralization: JSON Database (Javascript)" and "Software Design & Engineering: JUnit Tests (Java)" Artifacts linked above.  Both of these Artifacts contain programs that require complex input to function, and a comprehensive approach to handling input exceptions leaves fewer vulnerabilities to be exploited by malicious users.  
          </p>

          <hr>
          <h3>Conclusion</h3>
          <p>
            My chosen Artifacts serve to showcase a well-rounded competency with various programming languages and IDEs while demonstrating core programming concepts and principles common across all projects.  These Artifacts also demonstrate my ability to learn and implement academic course content, as well as competently pursue completely new topics and technologies without external guidance or structure.  The documents linked above and the content within this ePortfolio serve to showcase my written communication skills, both in academic settings and when conveying concepts to those who may not be familiar with the given material.  A firm and passionate understanding of data structures and algorithms in theory and practice is displayed in my written report and aptly named Artifact, while this very website serves as a testament to my grasp of software engineering and data centralization.  My insistence on adhering to version control best practices and accounting for as many program exceptions as I am aware of limits the number of vulnerabilities in my code, and my plans regarding overall security protocols outlined in my written report demonstrate my ability to perceive and handle issues from a broader perspective.
