            This subsite is dedicated to my ePortfolio, detailing several of my most impressive and technically relevant projects.  Each of the buttons in the table to the right will take you to a page with more details about the selected project, along with a link to the project files on GitHub, a detailed description of the project, and a narrated screencast explaining and demonstrating the project when applicable.

          <h3>Narratives</h3>
          These are the journals I submitted throughout my capstone course as I enhanced each of my ePortfolio artifacts.  The relevant content within these journals has been incorporated in the pages found to the right as well as the project repository README file.  As such, they can be ignored or overlooked if you prefer to go over the README instead.  This list of pdfs simply serves to concisely document the lifespan of the ePortfolio.

          <h3>Professional Self-Assessment</h3>
          <p style='display: none;'>
            Discuss how completing your coursework throughout the program and developing the ePortfolio has helped showcased your strengths and shape your professional goals and values and prepared you to either enter or become more employable in the computer science field. Use specific examples from your program and include examples outside of the artifacts included in your ePortfolio. Please address following topics: collaborating in a team environment, communicating to stakeholders, data structures and algorithms, software engineering and database, and security. Note: This should function as an overall introduction to your skills and you will become more specific relative to the included artifacts in the next section. 
            <br><br>

            Summarize/introduce how your artifacts fit together and inform the portfolio as a whole; this will help demonstrate the full range of your computer science talents and abilities? This section should introduce your audience to the technical artifacts that will follow the professional self-assessment.
