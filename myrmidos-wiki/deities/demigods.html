                Demigods are the offspring of a mortal and any of the other deities, and as a result, are the most varied category of divine being.  Offspring between mortals and the Titans are extremely rare, and offspring between mortals and genies are only a small measure more common.  The vast majority of demigods are children of the Greater Deities and mortals, usually becoming noteworthy in historical records.  The gods tend to favor their children, and their children have a tendency to accomplish great things.  Many of the powers that demigods can manifest are directly related to their parent's domain, including spells from the associated school of magic and abilities unique to the native elementals.  The nature of divine manifestation that demigods exhibit are wildly vvaried, even among those with the same heritage.  For example, a demigod of Deliklese might be able to take on a bestial form much like a lycanthrope to better stalk her prey, while another demigod of Delkilese might be able to convert his body into an ooze like substance to pass through small cracks and avoid being harmed by slashing weapons.

                While less common than mortal demigods, there are some known examples of demigods with dragons or beasts as the mortal parent.  These creatures often become utter legend, making them difficult to track and document.  While dragons are inherently deific to some degree, they are in fact mortal despite what some might insist.  Dragons do age and eventually die of old age, although after an admittedly long lifespan.  Only dragon demigods are able to live indefinitely and attain the status of GreatWyrm.  While some dragons do extend their lifespan through necromancy, this does not allow them to continue growing naturally, and thus stunts their development.  GreatWyrms are a remarkably powerful category of creature, not quite a God, but certainly exceeding the Genies.  
                <br><br>
                There is some speculation about whether some varieties of creature are descendants of demigods, therianthropes being chief among them.  While not an uncommon perception, therianthropes are not directly related to demigods at all.  A demigod might be able to contract therianthropy, but the curse is exactly that; a curse.  Demigods possess innate abilities that cannot be acquired or removed.  It is technically impossible to prove that therianthropy did not originate from a feral demigod, but there is no evidence in favor of such a theory.
