            "entry_description_overview" : "Viridian Dragons are revered by those who value nature, and are often incorporated in pagan religions.  Viridian Dragons keep to themselves and guard their chosen territory with relentless cunning and brutality.  They have been commonly known to allow nomads passage through their territory, and even allow hunters to stalk their territory if they are deemed worthy and respectful of the nature around them.  In many ways, Viridian Dragons are literal guardians of nature itself, behaving as ethical stewards of their land while living off of it.  Stories of Viridian Dragons that have saved herds of deer from raging dire crocodiles or feral therianthropes are not uncommon, with the dragon leaving the herd intact afterwards in most cases.  Their fearsome appearance and large menacing horn often provokes conflict with those who are unfamiliar with their nature, especially mercenaries or soldiers who are unknowingly trespassing.  ",

The mortals who do happen across Copper Dragons, both in their lair and elsewhere, are either dismissed as irrelevant and spoken with as briefly as possible to obtain the desired information, or, obsessively analyzed, questioned, and challenged in a civil battle of words and wits.

They find a great deal of joy in tracking cargo shipments and reviewing warehouse stock levels.  Bronze Dragons usually procure treasure from sunken vessels and return it to the rigthful owner with fees for their service removed, allowing them to amass small fortunes that they then use to invest in seafaring cargo shipment companies.  You would be hard pressed to find a mercantile coster with seafaring vessels that doesn't have the financial backing of a Bronze Dragon.  While Bronze Dragons do value civility and order as any Metallic Dragon would, they hold a remarkably potent resentment for pirates.  Gold Dragons are widely considered the most brutal and vengeful of the Metallic Dragons, but accounts of Bronze Dragons razing pirate vessels certainly makes them a competitor for that heading.  ",

            "entry_description_overview" : "Silver Dragons are the most interested in mortal affairs of all the dragons.  They often seek to offer council to rulers in government and judges in courts of law.  Silver Dragons utterly despise those who corrupt the legal system, having been known to publicly execute government officials who fail to uphold the oath they took.  Their lairs are often adorned with documents and organizational symbols, such as house crests or the statue that presided over a courthouse.  The treasure they value most of all are legislative documents from nations past, often spending hours poring over them and coming up with new ideas to present to the nobles they advise.  ",

They often insert themselves in mortal societies with a series of rotating interests, the most stable of which being art.  Brass Dragons fill their lairs with the most unique and potent works of art they can find, often treasuring their newest pieces most dearly.  They constantly redecorate and cycle through their collection to adorn their lair in different combinations from year to year, sometimes forgetting about pieces they own that are buried in the back of their storage chambers.  There have been relics from cultures thousands of years old found in Brass Dragon hoards, and they are just as prone to give it away as they are to defend it with their lives.  As unreliable as Brass Dragons may be, any city fortunate enough to find a Brass Dragon setting up permanent residence within its walls is sure to find itself much wealthier as it becomes a central hub of culture and expression.
