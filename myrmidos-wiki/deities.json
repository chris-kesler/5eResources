            "deity_description" : "The Goddess of Ice and Honor is also known as the Arbiter of all Law. She helped forge the Edict during The Binding of the Lesser Deities, and oversees its observation in the mortal world. When the Edict is crossed, Frydeia does her part to dole judgment as she sees fit so that the Edict need not balance the offense itself. This is to avoid absolute catastrophe, since the Edict is raw power. That isn't say that Frydeia is merciful by mortal standards; she has had entire kingdoms put to the blade when a noble is being especially stubborn. Because of this, some believe that the Edict would resolve things in a kinder way than Frydeia does, and her intervention is solely for her own enjoyment. These rumors have not been shown to bother the Arbiter or her followers in the past.            <br><br>The Sigil of Frydeia is a downwards sword whose guard forms the arms of a merchant's scale. The favored form of Frydeia is that of a knight with a crystalline carapace.            <br><br>The Arbiter rules over the plane of Ice, which is home to the Contructs. These beings the mechanical denizens created and powered by Frydeia's psionic abilities.            <br><br>The Arbiter commands a strict religious sect of followers who seek to assist any nation in maintaining order. While the Arbiter herself does not condemn evilness as long as order is maintained, the organization has adopted its own additional standards that focus on peace, diplomacy, and violent intervention only when no other reasonable option presents itself. This group is known as the Magistrate, and its members are known as Magisters. Their ranks include mostly gishes such as Bladesingers and Twilight Clerics, but also War Magic Wizards and Peace Clerics. They exist outside of any nation's jurisdiction.            ",

The meaning behind this act is still a matter of debate.  <br><br>Sebabos is Neutral Evil in that he brings the prolonging of suffering whenever he can, but that is not to say he reigns mayhem whenever he can.  He remains utterly detached from mortal affairs, but happily tricks and beguils mortals whenever the opportunity presents itself.  He relishes suffering that is brought about by one's own actions, only intervening in a literal sense in the most enticing of circumstances.  <br><br>Sebabos is deeply in love with Deliklese, and continually gifts her with reaped souls from mortals he has won and swindled.  <br><br>While Sebabos is accurately referred to as a Deceiver and Reaper, he does not prefer to wield a scythe as some pagan interpretations depict.  Sebabos' preferred weapon and tool is that of a black bladed axe akin to a headsman, with discreet golden insets. He dislikes all color save for the sheen of gold, and many legends tell of those who have bought extra weeks or months of life with their vast fortunes.  ",
