              <p>
                There are four Types of Deities.  
                The oldest and arguably most powerful are the Titans.  
                There are four Titans, with each one inhabiting a primary elemental plane.  
                Each Titan had a child with each of the other Titans, and those children whose parents inhabited adjacent planes became Greater Deities.  
                The children whose Titan parents were not of adjacent planes, meaning opposite planes such as Earth/Air or Water/Fire, those children became formless beasts known as Mimics.  
              <br><br>
                There are four Greater Deities, with each one inhabiting a border elemental plane.  
                The Greater Deities had children with each other much like the Titans did, except in far greater numbers.  
                The offspring of two Greater Deities who inhabited adjacent planes became a Lesser Deity, also known as a Genie.  
                These Genies had the characteristics of whichever primary element their parents shared, but could wield universal magic due to their connection to the other planes.  
                The offspring of Greater Deities who did not share adjacent planes became formless humanoids who could only manipulate the magic within themselves.  
                They became known as the Creator Race, and while they possessed a great deal of magic, they could not release it into the world.  
                The only application for their power was to change the way they manifest and present themselves.  
                These are the ancestors of the Changelings.  
              <br><br>
                The members of the Creator Race had all the capacity of an actual god but none of the abilities.  
                The Greater Deities were having children with each other somewhat carelessly, so there were quite a few members of the Creator Race by the time Kushim, the first one, decided to start building a home for himself in the Material Plane.  
                The Creator Race banded together in order to make survival easy.  
                Social groups formed instantly, and laws came shortly after.  
                Before long, great structures were being designed and built, and advancements in science were progressing at an alarming rate.  
                The Creator Race even managed to build an outpost on Myrmidos's moon.
              <br><br>
                At the height of their power, the Creator Race was the perfect civilization.  
                They commanded the Material Plane and perfectly managed all the resources they had available.  
                This made the Genies, who inhabited the primary elemental planes, quite envious.  
                The Genies banded together to conquer the Material Plane and enslave the Creator Race.  
                The results of this conquest were catastrophic.  
              <br><br>
                Only ten members of the Creator Race managed to survive the slaughter.  
                Nearly everything that had been built was demolished, and it seemed the entire world was soaked in the blood of the Creator Race.  
                Furious and afraid for their domains, the Greater Deities gathered to forge an unbreakable ward known as The Edict.  
                On this Edict, they bound each Genie to a vessel so that they might never again use their godly magic to upset the balance of the world.  
                Having some compassion for their children but still wanting them to learn from their misbehavior, the Genies were allowed a way to free themselves; 
                they had to give up their powers and become mortal, just as the Creator Race they loathed so much.  
                Very few Genies chose to become mortal, but those that did became the first members of the Genasi race.
              <br><br>
                The members of the Creator Race that remained ere filled with sorrow, and longed for a release to their pain.  
                They longed to rebuild what had been lost, but the anguish crippled them from doing so.  
                Taking pity on them, Gondarin proposed a new idea.  
                Gondarin forged each of the members of the Creator Race into Metallic Dragons; two of each variety.  
                Gondarin then made a new kind of being for the Creator Race to watch over and guide; humans.  
              <br><br>
                While the Creator Race had built an incredibly powerful civilization, it had not been perfect.  
                These newly forged Metallic Dragons were filled with joy to see mankind begin to flourish.  
                They happily lived among them as both Dragons and shapeshifted into humanoids, teaching them about agriculture and other primitive sciences.  
                When the Metallic Dragons had children with each other, those offspring became Metallic Dragons as well.  
                However, when a shapeshifted Metallic Dragon had a child with a human, that child became a Changeling as we know them today.  
                Eventually, mankind grew to fear the Chromatic Dragons and magic itself, projecting both onto the Metallic Dragons.  
                The era of superstition had begun, and the Metallic Dragons were forced to keep their true nature a secret in order to avoid provoking conflict.  
              <br><br>
                Over time, humans began to reproduce with a number of other compatible races, most notably the Greater Deities themselves.  
                The Titans were too primal and beastlike to anything but another Titan as a potential mate.  
                The Lesser Deities that held onto their power viewed mortals with digust, never wanting to so much as touch them.  
                But the Greater Deities, they spent time amongst mortals on occasion.  
                And that occasionally led to the conception of a Demigod.  
              <br><br>
                Demigods are half Greater Deity and half mortal.  
                The Demigods can be loosely broken down into subtypes based on their divine heritage, but the characteristics and manifested abilities are so varied that such categorization is of little use.  
                There isn't much that can be said about Demigods as a blanket type of deity, except that they often have a great amount of influence over their era.  
                In fact, many eras are marked as beginning or ending based on the birth or death of a Demigod.  
              <br><br>
                The only other beings with direct heritage tying back to the deities are the mimics that came about from Titans of opposite planes.  
                The first Mimics were massive, and their children became progressively smaller.  
                It is unknown is the original Mimics still live, or where they might located.
