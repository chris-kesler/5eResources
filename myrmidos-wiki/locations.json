She has been working as a reporter and journalist in Hammerdeep for over four hundred years, and many people consider her the default source for information on modern events.

							"subcontent" : "<i>The number of troll sightings has been steadily increasing over the past decade, leading some including myself to wonder what might be causing such a trend in the Hutam, the Ruins of the Lost Dwarves (حطام الأقزام المفقودين) below our city.  Are the trolls growing in numbers?  Have they run out of prey to hunt down below?  Are they being driven out by a larger, more dangerous threat?  Ragnum Stoutblade, the well known and feared barkeep who owns the tavern on Cook Street had this to say about last night's troll attack, <br><br>-'It's a pain, especially since they like turning up right around dusk when every damn body is here trying to have a drink.  They always tear the place up a bit and some of the patrons get hurt every now and then.  Maybe it's bad for business, maybe that kind of excitement is what draws people here.  Either way, I'm just glad that two of my customers pitched in and helped kill the blasted thing.  Never met a troll I can't handle, but I'm getting older and it's nice to have some backup.'  <br><br>When asked about what might be causing the increase in sightings, Ragnum Stoutblade had this to say <br><br>-'Hadn't noticed honestly.  Trolls are dumb brutes, they don't strategize.  If they are getting bolder, it's probably cause there are more of them than there used to be.  Maybe it's time to get a good posse together to drive the last of em out of Hammerdeep, pitchforks and all.'  <br><br>While driving the trolls out for good might seem a tempting proposition, I'm typically wary of enraged crowds.  It is far too easy to let things get out of hand when one is possessed by the fury of the mob.  Regardless of what might be causing these troll attacks, patrons headed to Cook Street can rest assured that Ragnum Stoutblade the barkeep will be able to slay any monsters that enter his tavern; just be sure to sit by a far wall or corner.  <br><br>May you greet the next dawn with a smile,<br>-Nuovis Magcyne (نوویس میگسین) with The Hindsight Chronicle (دی ہندسائٹ کرانیکل)</i>"

							"subheading" : "Underclan Uprising - Kythorn 3rd, 1329",
							"subcontent" : "<i>Last night at the junction between Fish Street and Snail Street, seven Hammerdeep citizens were murdered in what appears to be a faction related incident.  The City Watch had cordoned off the area shortly after sunset and arrested three suspects.  The officer on scene insisted they had the situation under control, and stated that the three suspects in custody had confessed to committing the murders.  Their motivations appear to be driven by pagan zealousy, stating that they were 'bringing glory to the Underclan' and that 'The Redeemer had awakened them'.  While an unofficial guild in Hammerdeep, this mysterious Underclan organization and Redeemer figure have been mentioned by a number of individuals found guilty of violent crimes in the past few months.  It's a troubling trend that leaves many wondering what the Watch is doing to protect us.  When asked about the safety of Hammerdeep citizens, Captain of the City Watch Hyustus Staget had this to say <br><br>-'We are working tirelessly to quell this evil uprising and maintain the peace.  Our patrols have been doubled in the last month alone, and we are able to respond to violent incidents faster than we ever have before.  While these deaths are certainly tragic, we can be grateful that our guards were able to arrive on scene as quickly as they did.  Had our latest policies not been in place, it is likely that we would be seeing as many as three times the number of victims we currently do.  I can assure the people of Hammerdeep that we are doing everything we can to keep the blood off the streets.'<br><br>Later that evening, a disturbance near a warehouse on Candle Lane had been reported to the City Watch.  Upon investigating, it was discovered that the warehouse had been in the employ of the notorious Grey Flock syndicate, and that the Underclan had killed several of their agents.  While the guards were less than eager to speak to me on the subject, I was able to gather that the Grey Flock had managed to kidnap an unnamed young noble man and hold him hostage there.  The Underclan members who were captured readily confessed that they had taken the noble away to the sewers and left his friend in the storage closet, who was taken away by another Underclan member shortly after.  Given the back to back incidents in such close proximity to each other, Captain Hyustus Staget's assurances fall a little flat.  When asked about this new development, Captain Staget had this to say, <br><br>-'We have underestimated the Underclan.  It is clear that they are more than zealots gripped by resentment, they are a competent terrorist organization capable of employing strategy in their attacks.  Some of my superiors would want me to tone down the details to avoid public panic, but I believe the people of Hammerdeep deserve the truth.  People of Hammerdeep, I call on you to maintain your composure and avoid adding to the dissent while we handle this delicate situation.  You can assist us by taking steps to defend yourselves and vigilantly reporting and suspicious activity.  We will get through this, but not if we let them strike fear into us.'<br><br>While the City Watch seems confident in their ability to stop these terrorists, it is difficult not to wonder about our safety in the meantime while this conflict is brought to a close.  Can the Watch really protect us against a threat we know so little about?  What is the Underclan exactly?  Who is the Redeemer, and what is their mission?  I will continue searching for answers to these questions in order to expose this warlord so they might be brought to justice.  Until then, keep your family close and stay indoors after nightfall.  Stay safe Hammerdeep.  <br><br>May you greet the next dawn with a smile,<br>-Nuovis Magcyne (نوویس میگسین) with The Hindsight Chronicle (دی ہندسائٹ کرانیکل)</i>"

Elves have been hedged out of many industries over the last few centuries.  While Elves have been known to attain a level skill in a given practice that is nearly impossible to match due to their long lifespans, it takes them far longer to learn a given practice in the first place.  As a result, tradesman are almost unanimously unwilling to take on an Elven apprentice in order to avoid repeatedly teaching the fundamentals for several decades.  The Elves simply can't afford to survive while taking such time to learn a trade, and have been bitterly adapting as a result.  Elves are most commonly found in unskilled labor positions, sometimes serving a specific company or family across multiple generations akin to a trusted servant.  While not a trend across the Elven race, it is not uncommon for Elves to tend archives such as historical databases, burial sites, cultural museums, or any other institution dedicated to preserving relics or information.  Some of the most knowledgeable historians in Hammerdeep are Elves who worked as bookkeepers or custodians while educating themselves between duties.  It is highly uncommon, but not unheard of, for an Elf to maintain a prestidigous career as a tradesman.  These cases are similar to the historians in that they worked an unskilled labor position while taking the time to teach themselves a craft or art for decades.  These few and far between Elven artisans are well known across the city, having literal centuries to forge their reputation.  "

This has led to Tieflings becoming disproportionately popular and successful as a species on average (it is still incredibly rare for a Tiefling to escape the Middle Class), but not without a cost; it is not uncommon for Tieflings to be seen or treated as commodities by the Upper Class.  Tieflings mature incredibly quickly (reaching adulthood in under a decade) due to their demon blood, and are capable of having children with all of the Majority races.  Interestingly enough, having one Tiefling parent results in a child that is a full blooded Tiefling.  Tiefling children come to term in a short two months.  However, their propensity for population growth is tempered by their shockingly short lifespans (it is unheard of for a Tiefling to live past 30 years old) and a complete disinterest in caring for their offspring (which is hardly as cruel as it sounds; Tiefling children are remarkably autonomous).

Orcs have proven exceptional animal handlers, dominating the husbandry industry.

Goliaths have remarkable respiratory systems attuned for thin atmospheres, making them well suited for intense physical labor.

The lair incorporates several rooms, including a main chamber for the dragon to rest in and display their favorite objects, a subjects chamber for their servants and slaves to live and sleep in, a vault to hold their greatest treasures, and a prison for containing unruly captives.  The floors, walls, and ceilings are all made from distorted glass.  The floors are the least transparent and most coplanar, having a thin layer of sand on top that scratches and flattens it through normal use.  "

They are covered in vibrant sea green scales, hence the name.  Their wings are conventional in structure, but have thicker, fleshier membranes than their batlike cousins.  The underside of their wing membrane is a dull ivory color, much like a barnacle.  A series of ivory colored vanes run along the Dragon's spine, culminating in a moderately sized central head crest.  Two vanes extend downwards from the Dragon's cheekbones, while a pair of rearfacing horns swoop back from the base of the skull.  The Turquoise Dragon's tail ends with a series of flexible tendrils akin to a jellyfish, which are only a shade more pale than the vanes.  "
						},
						{
							"subheading" : "Anatomy",
							"subcontent" : "Turquoise Dragons are anatomically similar to sharks in a number of ways.  Firstly, their scales are much smaller than those of other dragons, being a series of tightly packed sharp dermal denticles rather than large layered plates.  This results in skin that appears smooth, but can tear open unprotected flesh should it rub against it with force.  Their bones are also far more flexible due to high levels of cartilage composition.  This allows the Turquoise Dragon to much more easily shrug of bludgeoning impacts, but makes it harder for them to maintain sustained flight over long distances.  While their wings are powerful, they are best suited for short bursts of flight and aquatic navigation; the flexibility of their skeleton makes endurance flight require far more effort.  Turquoise Dragons also have a series of ever replenishing teeth that move forward as they grow.  While this process is similar to that which sharks undergo, the functionality of the Dragon's jaws are more akin to a large constrictor snake.  The smaller teeth that have yet to move forward serve as one way skewers, preventing anything in the Dragon's mouth from sliding out once it's been latched onto.  <br><br>Lastly, Turquoise Dragons have a set of robust gills, although not in the typical sense.  The ivory colored membranes, underbelly, and tail vanes of the Turquoise Dragon serve to pull oxygen from the surrounding water at an alarming rate.  Turquoise Dragons have remarkable endurance when underwater, which is likely due to their heightened ability to satisfy their cardiovascular system.  While the tail vanes of a Turquoise Dragon do serve as gills in some sense (and the most robust of the Dragon's gills at that), they also serve another purpose; they are visually and functionally similar to a jellyfish's stingers, containing a series of neurotoxins that inflict an immobilizing surge of pain.  While the toxins employed are not among the most powerful when compared to jellyfish, the effect of the tail is sufficient to partially paralyze or numb an area roughly one tenth of the Dragon's size.  The duration of this effect varies based on the Dragon's age, with Hatchlings and Juveniles only inflicting it for a few seconds, while the sting from Wyrms can linger for days.  "

They sometimes succeed by using their psychic blast and tail stingers to gain an advantage, but lose just as often.  Turquoise Dragons have no issue with fleeing a fight, becoming even more adept at escaping than they are at hunting.  Once the Dragon is an Adult, it is capable of hunting all but the greatest sharks with ease.  At this age, they clash with similarly sized foes less often, but still actively go after orcas and dire squids when they can.  Adult Dragons are still wary of large lurking threats, such as sperm whales and dire sharks.  By the time the Dragon is a Wyrm, they have very very few natural predators remaining.

Viridian Dragons keep to themselves and guard their chosen territory with relentless cunning and brutality.  They have been commonly known to allow nomads passage through their territory, and even allow hunters to stalk their territory if they are deemed worthy and respectful of the nature around them.  In many ways, Viridian Dragons are literal guardians of nature itself, behaving as ethical stewards of their land while living off of it.  Stories of Viridian Dragons that have saved herds of deer from raging dire crocodiles or feral therianthropes are not uncommon, with the dragon leaving the herd intact afterwards in most cases.  Their fearsome appearance and large menacing horn often provokes conflict with those who are unfamiliar with their nature, especially mercenaries or soldiers who are unknowingly trespassing.  "

Bronze Dragons usually procure treasure from sunken vessels and return it to the rigthful owner with fees for their service removed, allowing them to amass small fortunes that they then use to invest in seafaring cargo shipment companies.  You would be hard pressed to find a mercantile coster with seafaring vessels that doesn't have the financial backing of a Bronze Dragon.  While Bronze Dragons do value civility and order as any Metallic Dragon would, they hold a remarkably potent resentment for pirates.  Gold Dragons are widely considered the most brutal and vengeful of the Metallic Dragons, but accounts of Bronze Dragons razing pirate vessels certainly makes them a competitor for that heading.  "

There have been relics from cultures thousands of years old found in Brass Dragon hoards, and they are just as prone to give it away as they are to defend it with their lives.
