                The links to the right contain lists with all factions of that type present.  
                The Factions in Earth-5 include any group of individuals who coordinate towards a common goal.  
                Some specific factions can be found under multiple categories.  
                Governing Nations are those who have actively held power at some point.  
                Political Contingents include any group who has a political agenda included in their common goal.  
                Religious Sects include those who worship any of the Greater Deities and act in accordance with their principles.  
                Occult Followings include those who worship indifferent beings such as the Titans or Genies.  
                Commercial Guilds include unions and similar associations for merchants, tradesmen, and craftsmen.
                Criminal Guilds are exactly that, guilds dedicated to gaining power or coin through crime.  
                Most have political agendas to fund, and are usually at odds with the local government.
                Terrorist Groups are usually Occults Followings or Political Contingents, but can be any type of Faction who resorts to violence against the general populace in order to achieve their goals.  
                These groups are often considered the common enemy of all other Factions in Earth-5.
