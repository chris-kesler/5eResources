						I ran this oneshot with the intent to play a witcher style creature hunt, and I'd say that it went rather well based on that expectation.  I had never played with nay of these players except Nani before, and was happily surprised to discover that the group meshed rather well.  
						<br><br>Xander was playing a College of Swords Bard Goblin named Lash the Loathsome, Anjel was playing a War Magic Wizard Tiefling named Aetris Levlia, Nub was playing a Four Elements Monk Eladrin named Godrick Everfall, and Nani was playing a Thief Rogue Half Elf named Theo.  
						<br><br>
						The enemy known as a Gelmandrae is indeed a Frost Salamander, and the portal discovered at the end directly linked to the border elemental plane of ice.  The particular chamber on that plane that it was linked to had transmutative properties that could turn living humanoids into creatures native to the plane of ice.  The ruins were left behind by the evolutionary predecessors to the Gith, before they took to the stars and were eventually enslaved by the Illithids.  Very little of that era remains, with the obscure remnants that do endure only managing due to the magical forces that preserve it against time.
