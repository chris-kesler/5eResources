                    <b>UPDATE:  The game was canceled, so there will be no future entries for this character.</b><br><br>                    A friend of mine invited me to join an in-person D&D group that had just started with all new players.  
                    I agreed after speaking with the DM a bit about the feel of the group, and was honestly very excited since I hadn't played D&D in-person in years.  
                    The party had already gone through two sessions and were very close to level 2, so I was told to simply roll up a level two character.  
                    The party comp without me included a male Orc Blood Hunter, a male Elf Ranger, a female Tielfing Bard, a female Elf Cleric, and a female Drow Rogue.  
                    Since these are new players, I decided to play a god mage so that nobody would feel overshadowed.  
                    Due to the party comp, an Int caster made perfect sense, So I made an Artificer 1 / Wizard 1.  
                    My race is Custom Lineage, Medium sized, Darkvision variable trait, Undercommon language, and Fey Touched (Int) for the feat.  
                    I chose Gift of Alacrity for my Fey Touched spell.  
                    <br><br>
                    The whole goal of this build is to be a force multiplier.  
                    I have Thieves' Tools prof from Artificer, and the Guidance cantrip, so I plan on assisting the Rogue with lockpicking using Guidance and Help.  
                    My spells include AoEs like Grease and debuffs like Command to help keep the enemies off balance while my allies defeat them.  
                    For cantrips I chose Thorn Whip for forced movement, Chill Touch for heal blocking, and Mind Sliver for save setup.  
                    <br><br>
                    With all that out of the way, let's get right to the backstory and Ruben's journal. . . 

                    <h2>Backstory</h2>
                    <hr>
                    Ruben Jarricor is a pale skinned male human born to a family of humble farmers.  
                    He was taken as a boy to become a Blood Hunter; he had no say in the matter.  
                    This order of Blood Hunters were known as the Feyblades.  
                    Upon completing his initial training, he was sent to the Feywilds to undergo a transformation ritual.  
                    Afterwards, Ruben was still human, but the magic of the ritual enhanced him.  
                    He gained the eyesight of an Elf, a greatly lengthened lifespan, and a taste of innate magic.  
                    Ruben survived the rest of his training, officially joining the ranks of the Feyblades.  
                    He quickly became known as one of the best swordsman in the realm, both due to his remarkable skill and his unconventional left-handed reverse-grip.
                    <br><br>
                    One fateful encounter at the age of 94 found Ruben with Wyvern poison coursing through his left forearm.  
                    He managed to survive and drive the Wyvern off by taking her eye, but by then the damage was done.  
                    Despite his and the healers' best efforts, Ruben lost his thumb and index finger, and what remained suffered from severe nerve damage.  
                    The only thing his mangled quivering hand could manage was holding onto the grip of a shield.  
                    His days of wielding a blade were over.  
                    <br><br>
                    Ruben was taken off of fieldwork and assigned to other duties such as sorting books and polishing armor.  
                    Crippled Feyblades are still Feyblades, but they are considered last for contracts.  
                    Ruben was determined to prove that his prime had not yet passed.  
                    Disciplined as he was, his left hand could never wield a blade with any measure of prowess again, and his intact off-hand would likely never measure up and take years to train properly.  
                    He needed a new discipline; magic.
                    <br><br>
                    All Feyblades know some spells, and Ruben had always cast them with his right hand; the hand that was still intact.  
                    It took time learning to scribe with his off-hand, but magic came quite naturally to him.  
                    He served the remainder of his term in the library and as a smith.
                    <br><br>
                    5 years after the incident, he left the order on good terms under medical retirement, hoping to return one day to show he still has a place in the field.  
                    As it stands, he seeks to test his new spells in combat and hone his abilities.  
                    To become a truly capable War Mage.  
                    However, all of it is a means to an end. . .
                    <br><br>
                    . . . to track down and slay the Wyvern that poisoned him.

                    <i>
                        I awoke tied down upon a stone altar, utterly unaware of how I came to be in this situation.  
                        Last I recall I was riding and camping along the road, making my way towards some settlement looking for work.  
                        Can't seem to remember where I was headed.  
                        My mind is foggy, I'll have to see if anything above ground jogs my memory.  
                        Regardless, I found my mouth gagged and my head covered with a sack so I could not see anything but the blur of my immediate surroundings.  
                        My captor seemed to be male, and took a great amount of pleasure in wounding me.  
                        I was left alone after some time with lacerations and bruises, but I was still in capable condition.  
                        Yelling for a time seemed to do little to improve my situation until a group of five strangers entered.  
                        A drow woman quickly cut my bindings, and I thanked her.  
                        She seemed to be light on her feet and quick with a blade.
                        <br><br>
                        The rest of the group comprised of a male Orcish Blood Hunter named Rodigog wielding a Warhammer, a shy female Tiefling Bard, a male Elven Ranger named Pinky who scours his surroundings like a hound, and a female Elven Cleric named Leia who seems perpetually unimpressed with her surroundings.  
                        Most ignored my presence and looted the room shamelessly.  
                        It took no remarkable insight to discern that they are mercenaries, bandits, plunderers, or some similar sort.  
                        <br><br>
                        The drow woman introduced herself as Sarnora, and informed me that they were contracted to clear out a group of pests raiding a cellar under a tavern.  
                        I offered to help them explore the remainder of this crypt as a thanks for freeing me.  
                        I was able to convince them of my capabilities, and they accepted me without much consideration.  
                        I'm glad to have allies, but in truth, I'm simply grateful they didn't try to kill me and loot as they seem so inclined on doing.  
                        <br><br>
                        We descended from the elevated room where I was being kept using some of my rope, and continued to the left into an open room.  
                        Several Kobolds were attempting to open a cell door, but we quickly slew them when they became hostile.  
                        My allies were hell bent on looting the cell, so I helped Sarnora pick the lock.  
                        Inside were several coins and a valuable ring.
                        <br><br>
                        We continued to the right through a hallway.  
                        I was able to spot and disable a rather nasty trap, further cementing my value as a member with these plunderers.  
                        The following room contained a statue with a riddle regarding the authenticity of gold coins.  
                        The left hand held 5, the right 4, yet they were balanced as though there were four in each on a merchant scale.  
                        I suspect that one coin is a counterfeit and that the balance is symbolic of currency value.  
                        Determining which one will likely involve checking their physical weight for cores of unexpected densities.  
                        I suggested we wait and address this riddle after clearing the rest of the crypt, which Pinky and everyone else quickly agreed to.
                        <br><br>
                        We continued forward, finding a locked door to the right.  
                        We were unable to pick the lock, so I peered through the keyhole using a lit ball bearing.  
                        Inside was a chest, which I intend to come back for.  
                        I may judge these people as plunderers, but I am not one to ignore resources.
                        <br><br>
                        We continued to the next room, which was styled after the inside of a cathedral, and found more Kobolds.  
                        They were dispatched quickly, though their leader did put up quite a fight.  
                        I found several healing potions in a strongbox at the back of the cathedral room where the leader was lurking.  
                        There appears to be a flight of stairs beyond as I write this.  
                        We will see where they lead after we are all rested and recovered.  
                        <br><br>
