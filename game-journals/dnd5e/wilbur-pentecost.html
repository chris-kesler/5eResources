                  I recently finished relocating from Hawaii to Arizona, and now have time to participate in Dungeons and Dragons games again.  I found a DM looking for players on DnDB's official discord server, and a oneshot to test my compatibility with the group was decided upon.  This character is for this oneshot.  
                  <br><br>
                  The oneshot is themed around horror and mystery, and I know nothing of the party comp.  I do know that this group is less than optimized, and I am happy to accomodate.  As a result, I created an Arcana Cleric named Wilbur Pentecost, who is level 6.  He has balanced stats and mostly support spell options.  The Arcana Cleric gets some nice cantrips, but the main appeal here is the Spellbreaker feature.  Being able to remove a mass debuff and infer the benefits of Aid on my entire party will make a big difference if we get hit with a Slow spell or something similar.   
                  <br><br>
                  Keeping with the theme of limiting my optimization tendencies, I opted not to take Guidance (it can slow the game down depending on the group).  I also picked the Custom Lineage race (Medium sized, an Int skill, Primordial language) with the Keen Mind feat for extra flavor.  At level 4 I took Skill Expert and snagged Nature Expertise to better represent my character's knowledge of creatures and the natural world.   
                  <br><br>
                  The whole goal of this build is to make my allies a bit harder to kill.  
                  <br><br>
                  I have some healing spells I can sling, both as bonus actions and as actions.  I have Mind Sliver to set enemies up for saves, I have Sacred Flame to exploit Radiant vulnerability, and I have a good variety of Int skills (with a solid Int to back it up).  Overall, I'll be doing very conventional Cleric things in combat.  
                  <br><br>
                  With all that out of the way, let's get right to the backstory from Wilbur's journal. . .

                  I have other journals from these times, but they have been filled.  Reading through all of them is troublesome, and perhaps this document will unexpectedly arrive in the hands of a stranger.  For these and other reasons, I will sum up the content of prior journals in order to give contect to my latest entries in this new book.  The synopsis is as follows. . . 
                  <br><br>
                  When I was a young boy, I never liked playing outside as much as everyone thought I ought to.  I much prefered staying indoors and scribbling little picutres or designs on whatever scraps of paper I could find around the farmhouse.  We lived just outside of town, a mere hours walk mind you.  My curiosity led me to the local scribe, who I became an apprentice to in my spare time.  I learned to read, and read I did.  
                  <br><br>
                  It took me until my tenth summer to read everything the scribe had available in his meager hamlet collection, so I began looking elsewhere.  By my fifteenth summer, I had read everything I could find in any town or settlement within fifty miles of my hometown.  
                  <br><br>
                  On my sisteenth birthday, I left home and moved to a large city.  I was able to find work as a scribe, but it was tough to get by.  Still, I had access to a library the likes of which I had never seen before.  That library alone took me five years to read through, during which I received several promotions.  
                  <br><br>
                  I looked to several other libraries afterwards, but even that only lasted another two years.  I had become a much faster reader since my teenage years.  
                  <br><br>
                  Becoming bored, I began to reflect more deeply on what I had read.  It had always bothered me that our compendiums were sorely lacking on the topic of creatures.  I made several inquiries regarding this, discovering that few adventurers are willing to offer detailed reports, and the reports that are received often contradict each other.  I also learned that scholars almost never go into the field to study creatures in the first place, and the ones that do usually don't survive.  
                  <br><br>
                  This irked me, so I decided to try and fill the gaps of knowledge in one of my favorite compendiums.  There was an abandoned house rumored to be haunted in my city.  I studied for a time, learning all I could about my destination and target, even preparing a ritual.  I went to the haunted structure and found what I was looking for.  
                  <br><br>
                  The spirit within was agitated at first, but a quick calming spell eased it greatly.  I studied it in great detail, and found it was in pain.  I had suspected as much, so I began the ritual I had prepared.  The spirit did not appreciate this, and it moved to harm me.  
                  <br><br>
                  A flash of blue light appeared, creating a protective ward between me and the spirit.  I saw two sigils within that ward; Abjuration and Boccob.  The spirit was repelled and stunned, long enough for me to complete my ritual.  It cried out in pain before having its corrupted aspects washed away.  It began to dissipate rapidly, but I heard it cry a weak "thank you. . ." before dispersing.  
                  <br><br>
                  I documented the entire experience in a journal.  I have also logged all the details I discovered regarding the spirit itself, verifying and disproving various claims present in the compendium.  
                  <br><br>
                  After this experience, I decided to reread the doctrine of Boccob with a bit less skepticism.  I found his values intriguing the first time, but now gave serious consideration to the material.  I decided to open myself to Boccob, if only to express my gratitude for his timely intervention.  The experience was lifechanging.  
                  <br><br>
                  Boccob made it clear that he found my work important, and that a few small changes in my lifestyle would allow me to invoke his magic; magic that would allow me to better study the creatures I long to understand.  I agreed, and developed my connection to Boccob in tandem with my studies, usually focusing on Undead creatures.  
                  <br><br>
                  There were more than a few close calls.  
                  <br><br>
                  I was taking too many risks and facing too few creatures.  I decided that I needed a safer approach, and a more varied one at that.  It took me nearly a tenday to come up with idea, but I then joined an Adventurer's Guild.  It seemed the perfect idea.  Many other Clerics went out on crusades of peace or to bathe in the heat of battle, why not I do the same in the pursuit of knowledge?  I'd be among a rough crowd, sure, but they face all kinds of nasty beasts on a monthly basis.  If all goes well, I might be able to build some rapport and get accurate first hand accounts of their experiences alongside my own experiences.  At the very least I'll have some gritty allies to watch my back.  
                  <br><br>
                  I decided to join, and have been assigned my first quest, which seems a notably mysterious one.  I have yet to meet my fellow party members, but I am quite eager to have allies.  I am also quite eager to unravel the secrets of our target and destination.  May Boccob guide me.
