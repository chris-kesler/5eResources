                <p>
                  I recently finished relocating from Hawaii to Arizona, and now have time to participate in Dungeons and Dragons games again.  I found a DM looking for players on DnDB's official discord server, and they agreed to let me into the campaign.  This character is for this campaign.  
                  <br><br>
                  The campaign was described as follows: "Aekunia is a small continent on a world where lots of races exist from all over the world and some from other realms. Aekunia was discovered around 1000 years ago and had no intelligent natives species. the current population is dominated by humans but with Dwarves mining in the mountains and Elves mostly living in the center of Aekunia.  Gaarstead is the largest and oldest City on the continent. Gaarstead is Ruled by a Royal human family and several other cities are under its rule. The Current King is Jonah Richfield the 4th."  Since the world is relatively young and already in a medieval era, I assumed that innovation occurs rather rapidly.  I spoke to the DM and they expressed a willingness or even eagerness to allow player characters the ability to invent things such as airships and other Eberron style devices.  
                  <br><br>
                  The existing party comp includes a Twilight Cleric, a Fathomless Warlock, a Berserker Barbarian, and a Transmutation Wizard.  Since all the soft skills and general party roles are covered, I thought about playing a Paladin to increase our frontline presence or a Rogue to cover the Dexterity based party needs.  Instead of either of those options, I opted to play an Artificer.  Guidance, a decent Dexterity score, and Tool Expertise leave Artificer's on par with most Rogues in regards to lockpicking, and I can contribute to combat in a variety of ways that Rogues can't.  
                  <br><br>
                  My Armorer is an Owlin who was born deformed and unable to fly.  A later accident resulted in this character losing portions of both legs and one arm.  The Arcane Armor serves as a prosthetic first and protective weapon second.  I'll be doing standard Armorer things in combat as the Infiltrator, such as using my Lightning Launcher and concentrating on helpful spells.  
                  <br><br>
                  I grabbed the Medium Armor Master feat at level 4 and took the Dimir Operative background.  I can use up to Half Plate without penalty (the DM handwaved the armor flight restrictions due to the subclass and feat), getting just as much AC as I would have with Heavy Armor.  I can also use Pass Without Trace for a nice combo.  Considering that I am Small and that Artificer's get Enlarge/Reduce, I've got myself a very potent infiltrator that can get into most places.  I won't be all too potent in combat, but if that becomes a problem later on I can dissassemble my Arcane Armor and create a Steel Defender, switching my subclass over to the Battle Smith.  I'll just need to have a few Prosthetic Limbs handy by then.  
                  <br><br>
                  With all that out of the way, let's get right to the backstory from Dorien's journal. . .

                    Another journal filled, another chapter of my life put behind me.  I'm setting out on a new path today, but some context might be in order.  Perhaps you don't know me or haven't read my other journals, so I'll do my best to sum things up.  My name is Dorien Sablenest, and I am the mercenary known as Talon.
                    <br><br>
                    When I hatched, I was deformed.  My wings were bent at odd angles and missing many feathers.  I was too young to remember of course; this is simply what I was told by my parents.  I did hear rumors and whispers that the other members of my village thought my parents ought to abandon me in the forest, but clearly they never did, and who knows how much truth there is to those whispers.  Best not to dwell on them.  
                    <br><br>
                    As I grew, my wings remained stunted.  I never learned to fly, and I found myself an outsider to many of my people's customs as a result.  Rather than dwell on these things, I pursued other interests of mine.  I explored books and manuscripts, becoming fascinated with the Elven tomes on arcana and the Human engineering manuals.  Our village was situated between two kingdoms, one Elven and one Human, so we received a great deal of skeptical generosity from both parties.  
                    <br><br>
                    I taught myself to read and write.  When I came of age, I set out to the Elven city of Thymesera.  Once there, I worked as a scribe and studied magic with every spare coin I could muster.  My living conditions were poor, but I endured.  I learned the fundamentals of Arcane magic, never becoming a prodigy, but having a firm grasp of the topic.  After I had enough knowledge to continue learning on my own, I began saving my coin and sought out the healer's guild.  My affliction turned out to be much more difficult to cure than I had anticipated.  If it were merely an injury, I could save enough coin and pay for the remedy, but healing magic can only restore what was once there.  I was quietly encouraged to seek out a flesh sculptor if I were truly determined, which I was.  
                    <br><br>
                    The flesh sculptor proved unsatisfactory.  Not only did she ask for a ridiculous amount of coin, but she made it clear she could not make my wings functional.  I was insulted.  I had no desire for beautiful wings that do not allow me to fly.  Do I look as a peacock?  I think not.  
                    <br><br>
                    I decided to leave and continue studying.  I needed a new discipline to keep my mind occupied.  I moved north to the Human Kingdom of Bramhull Khar, where I continued working as a scribe.  I began studying engineering, and a particularly brilliant man "took me under his wing" (which is apparently a saying humans use to indicate mentorship, as strange as it might be).  His name was Roland Cannith, and I enjoyed working as his apprentice as he treated me very kindly.  He designed all kinds of things from trebuchets, to drawbridges, to water powered forges, to cloth parachutes that dampen an objects fall from a great height.  
                    <br><br>
                    One of his designs in particular cuaght my eye; a winged machine that could carry a man through the sky.  I became obsessed with this idea, encouraging it and working tirelessly on the concept.  Eventually, we were able to make a successful glider, but it could do nothing more than glide.  I was much lighter (and more willing to risk injury), so I served as the test pilot.  It was a success, and the most exhilarating experience of my life.  
                    <br><br>
                    I doubled my efforts, determined to make a machine that could fly rather than glide.  It proved fruitless though, as we couldn't come up with a power source that would suffice.  That's when I decided to experiment with incorporating magic.  My mentor did not approve, but agreed to let me use his workshop after hours as much I liked.  
                    <br><br>
                    My experiments showed much promise, but I became a bit oo bold.  One notable experiment went awry, casuing a small explosion.  It wasn't nearly powerful enough to destroy the workshop, but it did cause some damage to the workbench and nearby wall.  I however, did not fare so well.  I lost half of my left arm and leg, along with my right foot.  I still have burns over the left side of my body, and feathers don't grow back there anymore.  
                    <br><br>
                    My mentor was very understanding of my situation, but urged me to cease my experiments.  I was spurned by my own failures.  I refused to let it go, so I took some of my old inventions back to my room and painstakingly modified them until I they served the purpose I needed.  I was able to construct crude prosthetics out of my old automatons, leaving behind my life as an engineer's apprentice.   
                    <br><br>
                    I was desperate for coin to continue my work.  My knowledge of mechanisms and small stature made thievery an easy trade to turn to, and it allowed me to acquire what I needed for additional experiments.  Lockpicking came quite naturally to me.  I'm not proud of what I did; I hope I can make it up to the people I harmed in some way.  
                    <br><br>
                    Surprisingly, my experiments worked almost perfectly.  Crime pays very well it turns out.  I was able to create an advanced set of magically powered mechanisms that would bond with a suit of armor, allowing it to recreate lost limbs that function identical to the original.  I had to have my stunted wings surgically removed, which was not a pleasant procedure by any margin.  It was well worth it though; the Arcane Armor worked perfectly.  I had wings of shimmering brass that responded to my thoughts just as my real hand did.  My other limbs were also compensated for, and I had a protective layer of armor covering my entire body.  I actually felt. . . powerful.  
                    <br><br>
                    For the first time in my life, I was able to soar through the sky.  It freed me.  I saw the city below me, and pondered how I gotten to where I am.  I felt a great deal of attonement was in order for my crimes, so I turned to legitimate work to earn coin.  My Arcane Armor proved to be far more than a mere prosthetic, making work as a bodyguard or even mercenary a viable option.  I started going by the name of Talon in order to avoid being recognized and arrested.
                    <br><br>
                    It took several years, but I was able to earn enough coin to pay back all the people I had robbed (I keep rather meticulous records).  The last visit I paid was to my old mentor, giving him the coin to cover the damages for my old explosion.  I never said who I was or what the coin was for, and can't say for certain, but I suspect he knew exactly who I was under the helmet.  
                    <br><br>
                    With a clean slate, I made my way to the capitol city of Garstead.  I was able to secure myself a position within the Adventurer's Guild, often being assigned a separate more discrete mission in addition to that of my companions.  I have worked as Talon in Garstead for several months, taking the time to rebuild a small mobile workshop for myself and arm myself with the tools of my trade.  
                    <br><br>
                    I have most recently been assigned to a caravan headed east with a group of adventurers I have not yet met.  Let's hope this mission is an uneventful one that allows me a quick return to my work.
