                I recently finished relocating from Hawaii to Arizona, and now have time to participate in Dungeons and Dragons games again.  I found a DM looking for players on DnDB's official discord server, and a oneshot to test my compatibility with the group was decided upon.  This character is for the campaign that I will hopefully join after the oneshot.    
                <br><br>
                The campaign was described as follows: "Varroth is a dark-fantasy world plagued by horrors and monstrosities.  Most people are on edge with the arrival of a creature dubbed The World Eater.  This gargantuan leviathan esque creature has the capabilities of literally consuming entire portions of continents.  Because of this, adventurers are the norm in Varroth with many parties seeking gold, glory, or answers.  This is a HEAVY character-based story where the story follows the Party and their choices!"  Since this world is dark and gritty, I wanted my character to reflect that in a complex manner.  
                <br><br>
                The existing party comp includes a Divination Wizard, Circle of Stars Druid, Zealot Barbarian, and Warlock/Sorcerer.  Since all the soft skills are covered and we have a Zealot Barbarian, I decided to play a Cleric.  Since the world is dark and gritty, I decided to play a Dhampir Death Cleric.  
                <br><br>
                My Dhampir Death Cleric is not what you might expect at first glance; Benson Aguilar worships the deity Jergal from within a sect known as the Companions of the Pallid Mask.  These cultists monitor and manage undead beings, including the overview of skeleton labor forces and the destruction of disruptive rogue vampires and liches.  Benson Aguilar specializes in the latter.  
                <br><br>
                I'll be doing standard Cleric things in combat such as slinging cantrips, healing allies, and concentrating on Spirit Guardians.  I intend to play up a bond with the Zealot Barbarian, claiming I was sent by my deity to assist them in their journey since they are in a weird living limbo between death and life.  I'll keep Revivify handy and encourage them to let loose since I can always bring them back from death's door.  
                <br><br>
                I grabbed the Fey Touched feat at level four to round out my Wisdom.  Misty Step helps represent my Dhampir mist form, and Gift of Alacrity represents my heightened Dhampir reflexes.  I took the Rakdos Cultist background for thematic reasons, and to gain some fire based spells like Hellish Rebuke that would be useful against undead while making sense for a follower of a hell based deity.  
                <br><br>
                With all that out of the way, let's get right to the backstory from Benson's journal. . .

                    In my youth, I courted war; thriving on the hatred of my enemy, basking in the glory of victory.  We hunted monsters of all kinds.  Werewolves, Hags, the odd Gnoll pack, but the real prize were Vampires.  The spawn were manageable; the full blooded ones proved much more resourceful.  When I did finally defeat one, it simply vanished and reappeared elsewhere after a month.  I was furious.
                    <br><br>
                    Desperate to destroy that which I hated, I sought out an oracle; a genie if you will.  The journey was frought with difficulty, but I prevailed.  My mission drove me.  When I encountered the oracle, it asked what I desired.  There was an old axim I used to aid me in my pursuits, "Know thy enemy as you know thyself.".  I wished to know my enemy, the vampire, as intimately as possible, so I might destroy them.  
                    <br><br>
                    I got what I wanted, but not in the manner I expected.  
                    <br><br>
                    I was transformed on the spot into a Dhampir; a living half blooded vampire.  The oracle dissipated instantly, leaving me alone with my wish fulfilled.  It took me a while to realize exactly what transpired.  When I returned to my order for assistance, I was cast out; hunted even.  
                    <br><br>
                    I had never considered what it might be like to be the monster before. . . cast out, forced to survive on nothing.  No help was offered to me, no cure, no sympathy; just fear and hate.  It was eye opening to say the least.  
                    <br><br>
                    After a long time, I found a way to walk between the light and the dark.  I found the church of Jergal.  The Companions of the Pallid Mask accepted me, welcomed me even.  Their perspective on undeath seemed the only realistic one I had witnessed.  Many cults worship the perversion of all things living and holy, while other churches damn everything that is even slightly corrupted.  
                    <br><br>
                    But these people. . . they were different.  They saw Necromancy as a tool that must be wielded effectively.  They managed hordes of undead, commanding them to work for the benefit of the church and overseeing their activities.  They also hunted down rogue undead such as feral vampires and demented liches, and they did so more effectively than my old order ever did.  They took an approach free from ideology, becoming better at the original task and finding usefulness in things that would be destroyed otherwise.  
                    <br><br>
                    I was eager to join, and was made a member rather quickly in my estimation.  I spent roughly two decades assisting where I could, which was difficult for me since I had lost the favor of Pelor.  It took a long time to learn Jergal's ways and earn his trust, but the result has been well worth it.  I am now beginning to increase in his favor, apply his teachings, and learn facts of reality I had never considered before.  The mysteries that I have been shown keep me humbled and awed in his presence.  
                    <br><br>
                    Most recently, Jergal has given me a vision; a vision of one who is banished from death but not undead.  A warrior whose soul is notably pliable to Necromancy magic, and particularly averse to death itself.  I intend to pledge my services to this warrior, learning what I can about their condition or affliction while helping them in whatever endeavors they deem worthy.  If this being is the first of a new variety of undead, my guild must be the first to know about it.
