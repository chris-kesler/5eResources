                  The four Elemental Titans Deities were the first sentient beings to form in the universe.  
                  Much in the same way that dense matter attracts other matter in space, dense energy attracts more energy within the Primal Elemental Planes.  
                  A type of energy specific to each plane begin to accumulate over eons, becoming capable of interacting with the environment.  
                  These masses of planar energy became alive, and eventually, sentient.  
                  For a very long time, these Titans were simply non-descript masses of their respective element.  
                  It is not known when or how the Titans developed their preferences for their appearances, but they did learn to take on a more corporeal form of their choosing.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Titan of Air presents as an avian, the Titan of Water presents as a cephalopod, the Titan of Earth a reptile, and the Titan of Fire an arachnid.  
                  They have aspects that are more complex than that, but even the brief description above shows that they are far more than standard elementals.  
                  In fact, it has been theorized that the origins of the standard elementals involve pieces of the Titans themselves that remained alive after being detached in some way.  
                  It's also quite possible that they came to be from pure planar energy just as the Titans did, and it is unknown if a method to test this thoery exists.  
                </p>
                <p>
                  The Titans rarely interact with each other, and the occasions in which they do leave a lasting impact on every plane for eons.  
                  The Titan of Fire has been known to show unwarranted aggression towards both the Titan of Air and the Titan of Earth.  
                  It often results in the Titan of Fire taking on a form that mocks the oppponent, and being driven off after some time.  
                  Some speculate that the Titan of Fire's behavior is intended to incite playfulness.  
                  Regardless, the Titans do not interact very often and are anything but affectionate.  
                  They did work as allies to slay the Dragon Titan, which has been the only known instance of such collaboration.  
                  It is commonly theorized that the aftermath of this event led to the conception of the Greater Deities, but records from that time period are notably difficult to obtain, if they exist at all.
