                Rather than acquiring the equipment granted by your class and background, you can elect to purchase your starting gear. 
                If you do so, you receive no equipment from your class and background, and instead roll for your starting wealth using the criteria below:

                <hr>
                <i><b>Visionary:</b>  1st level</i>
                <br>
                You have gained intimate knowledge of technology far beyond your time, and are capable of apply these technologies in a variety of ways.  
                See the Rules for Techcasting mechanics and Technologies list.  
                <br><br>
                <b>Technologies Known</b>
                <br>
                You learn 4 Technologies of your choice, and you learn an additional 4 at each higher Visionary level as shown in the Tehcnologies Known column of the Visionary table.  
                You may not learn a Technology of a level higher than your Max Technology Level, and you may learn a Technology at the same time you learn its prerequisite.  
                <br><br>
                <b>Tech Points</b>
                You have a number of Tech Points equal to your Visionary level x 8, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Visionary table, + your Int modifier.  
                You use these Tech Points to cast Tech Powers.  
                You regain all expended Tech Points when you finish a long rest.
                <br><br>
                <b>Max Tech Level</b>
                <br>
                Many Technologies can be overpowered, consuming more Tech Points to create a greater effect. 
                You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Tech Level column of the Visionary table.
                You may only cast Technologies at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. 
                You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.
                <br><br>
                <b>Techcasting Ability</b>
                <br>
                Your Techcasting ability is Intelligence.
                You use your Intelligence modifier whenever a Technology refers to your Techcasting ability. 
                Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Technology you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
                <br><br>
                <b>Technology save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
                <br><br>
                <b>Technology attack modifier</b> = your proficiency bonus + your forcecasting ability modifier
                <br><br>
                
                <h3>Tech Recovery</h3>
                <hr>
                <i><b>Visionary:</b>  1st level</i>
                <br>
                You have learned to repair and recharge some of your Technologies in the field. 
                When you finish a short rest, you can regain a number of Tech Points equal to half your Visionary level (rounded down) + your Intelligence modifier (minimum of one). 
                Once you’ve used this feature, you must complete a long rest before you can use it again.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Expertise</h3>
                <hr>
                <i><b>Visionary:</b>  2nd level</i>
                <br>
                Choose two of your skill proficiencies and two of your tool proficiencies. 
                Your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the chosen proficiencies.
                <br><br>

                <h3>Augmented Armor</h3>
                <hr>
                <i><b>Visionary:</b>  3rd level</i>
                <br>
                Your metallurgical pursuits have led to you making advanced armor a conduit for your technology. 
                As an action, you can turn a suit of armor you are wearing into Augmented Armor, provided you have Inventor's Tools in hand.
                <br>
                You gain the following benefits while wearing this armor:
                <br>
                If the armor normally has a Strength requirement, the Augmented Armor lacks this requirement for you.
                You can use the Augmented Armor as a spellcasting focus for your artificer spells.
                The armor attaches to you and can’t be removed against your will. It also expands to cover your entire body, although you can retract or deploy the helmet as a bonus action. The armor replaces any missing limbs, functioning identically to a limb it replaces.
                You can doff or don the armor as an action.
                The armor continues to be Augmented Armor until you don another suit of armor or you die.
