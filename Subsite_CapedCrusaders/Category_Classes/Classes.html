              <p>
                There are twelve classes available to you as a player within Caped Crusaders.  
                These classes are placed into categories based on the source of their abilities.  
                There are twelve classes in total, with four classes in each category.  
                The categories are Technology, Powers, and Magic.  
                <br><br>
                Each category has a Primary Caster, a Secondary Caster, a Secondary Martial, and a Primary Martial.  
                For example, the Visionary is the Primary Technology Caster, the Nova is the Primary Power Caster, and the Archmage is the Primary Magic Caster.  
                <br><br>
                A Caster Class is one that uses expendable resources in order to produce powerful effects.  
                An example would be unleashing a massive Lightning Bolt.  
                It may not use resources in a physical sense, but the character won't be able to unleash them at will all day long without getting extremely tired.  
                All classes gain at least a small amount of casting, but some get more than others.  
                <br><br>
                A Martial Class is one that relies on innate abilities that are always active.  
                An example would be a character with super strength and flight.  
                Those attributes are always active and can be used continually to a reasonable degree.
                All classes get at least a few always active abilities, but again, some get more than others. 
                <br><br>
                Each Class balances Casting and Martial features in varying amounts.  
                The subclasses are intended to augment the main source of abilities and create a generally equal playing field among players.  
                That being said, each class does widely different things aren't exactly comparable in their niches.  
                You cannot expect a Magus to pack a punch all day long like a Soldier, and likewise shouldn't expect a Spellwright to be able to tailor the battlefield like a Subvertist.  
                <br><br>
