                <br>
                You have gained intimate knowledge of technology far beyond your time, and are capable of apply these technologies in a variety of ways.  
                See the Rules for Techcasting mechanics and Technologies list.  
                <br><br>
                <b>Technologies Known</b>
                <br>
                You learn 4 Technologies of your choice, and you learn an additional 4 at each higher Subvertist level as shown in the Technologies Known column of the Subvertist table.  
                You may not learn a Technology of a level higher than your Max Technology Level, and you may learn a Technology at the same time you learn its prerequisite.  
                <br><br>
                <b>Tech Points</b>
                You have a number of Tech Points equal to your Subvertist level x 8, as shown in the Tech Points column of the Subvertist table, + your Int modifier.  
                You use these Tech Points to cast Tech Powers.  
                You regain all expended Tech Points when you finish a long rest.
                <br><br>
                <b>Max Tech Level</b>
                <br>
                Many Technologies can be overpowered, consuming more Tech Points to create a greater effect. 
                You can overpower these abilities to a maximum level, which increases at higher levels, as shown in the Max Tech Level column of the Subvertist table.
                You may only cast Technologies at 6th, 7th, 8th, and 9th-level once. 
                You regain the ability to do so after a long rest.
                <br><br>
                <b>Techcasting Ability</b>
                <br>
                Your Techcasting ability is Intelligence.
                You use your Intelligence modifier whenever a Technology refers to your Techcasting ability. 
                Additionally, you use this ability score modifier when setting the saving throw DC for a Technology you cast and when making an attack roll with one.
                <br><br>
                <b>Technology save DC</b> = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Techcasting ability modifier
                <br><br>

                Your inventive pursuits have led to you making armor that serves as a conduit for your technology. 
                As part of a Long Rest, you can turn a suit of mundane armor you have access to into Augmented Armor, provided you have Inventor's Tools on hand.
                You can don or doff the Augmented Armor over the course of 1 minute.
