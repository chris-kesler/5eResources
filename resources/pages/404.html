                Quite a bit of this site is filled with placeholder pages that emulate the navigation features I have in mind.  
                Filling in the actual content takes much longer, so I appreciate your patience while I continue building this site.  
                In the meantime, please feel free to check out some pages that are ready for viewing such as those within the "Deities" and "Planes" categories within the Myrmidos Wiki.  
                <br><br>
                If you can't be bothered to wait around for me to finish the site alone and would like to contribute to this site in some way, feel free to reach out on LinkedIn, GitHub, or Discord.
